    "answersDescription": "Legacy bus-topology Ethernet LAN uses CSMA/CD as network media access control protocol. It works by detecting a collision in the medium and backing off (after transmitting a jam signal) as necessary. When one host wants to transmit a frame, it listens on the medium to check if the medium is busy. After it senses that no one else is transmitting, the host starts transmitting the frame, it also monitors the current level to detect a collision. If it detects a collision, it transmits a special jam signal so that all other hosts can know there was a collision. The other host will receive this jam signal and stop transmitting. After this, both hosts enter an exponential backoff phase and retry transmission.",

    "questionText": "",
    "answersDescription": "With shared memory buffering, the number of frames stored in the buffer is restricted only by the of the entire memory buffer and not limited to a single port buffer. This permits larger frames to be transmitted with fewer dropped frames. This is important to asymmetric switching, which applies to this scenario, where frames are being exchanged between ports of different rates. With port-based memory buffering, frames are stored in queues that are linked to specific incoming and outgoing ports making it possible for a single frame to delay the transmission of all the frames in memory because of a busy destination port. Level 1 cache is memory used in a CPU. Fixed configuration refers to the port arrangement in switch hardware.",

    "questionText": "",
    "answersDescription": "A switch using the store-and-forward switching method performs an error check on an incoming frame by comparing the FCS value against its own FCS calculations after the entire frame is received. In comparison, a switch using the cut-through switching method makes quick forwarding decisions and starts the forwarding process without waiting for the entire frame to be received. Thus a switch using cut-through switching may send invalid frames to the network. The performance of store-and-forward switching is slower compared to cut-through switching performance. Collision detection is monitored by the sending device. Store-and-forward switching does not use IPv4 Layer 3 and 4 information for its forwarding decisions.",

A detector in the network interface of a destination device must receive a signal that can be successfully decoded to match the signal sent.

    "question": "Which field in the IPv4 header is used to prevent a packet from traversing a network endlessly?",
    "questionText": "",
    "answersDescription": "The value of the Time-to-Live (TTL) field in the IPv4 header is used to limit the lifetime of a packet. The sending host sets the initial TTL value; which is decreased by one each time the packet is processed by a router. If the TTL field decrements to zero, the router discards the packet and sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Time Exceeded message to the source IP address. The Differentiated Services (DS) field is used to determine the priority of each packet. Sequence Number and Acknowledgment Number are two fields in the TCP header.",

However, when a host needs to send a message to a remote network, it must use the router, also known as the default gateway. This is because the data link frame address of the remote destination host cannot be used directly. Instead, the IP packet has to be sent to the router (default gateway) and the router will forward the packet toward its destination. Therefore, if the default gateway is incorrectly configured, the host can communicate with other hosts on the same network, but not with hosts on remote networks.",

Manually configuring static ARP associations is a way to prevent, not facilitate, ARP poisoning and MAC address spoofing. Multiple ARP replies resulting in the switch MAC address table containing entries that match the MAC addresses of connected nodes and are associated with the relevant switch port are required for normal switch frame forwarding operations.

    "answersDescription": "In a TCP session, when a device has no more data to send, it will send a segment with the FIN flag set. The connected device that receives the segment will respond with an ACK to acknowledge that segment. The device that sent the ACK will then send a FIN message to close the connection it has with the other device. The sending of the FIN should be followed with the receipt of an ACK from the other device.",

This information could simply be collected or modified for a specific purpose and delivered to its original destination.\r\nEavesdropping attack – When devices are being installed, the threat actor can intercept data such as security keys that are used by constrained devices to establish communications once they are up and running.\r\nSQL injection (SQLi) – Threat actors uses a flaw in the Structured Query Language (SQL) application that allows them to have access to modify the data or gain administrative privileges.\r\nRouting attack – A threat actor could either place a rogue routing device on the network or modify routing packets to manipulate routers to send all packets to the chosen destination of the threat actor. The threat actor could then drop specific packets, known as selective forwarding, or drop all packets, known as a sinkhole attack.",

If this limit is exceeded, no further logins are allowed for the specified period of time. This helps to mitigate brute-force password cracking since it will significantly increase the amount of time required to crack a password. The exec-timeout command specifies how long the session can be idle before the user is disconnected. The service password-encryption command encrypts the passwords in the running configuration. The banner motd command displays a message to users who are logging in to the device.",

    "question": "Refer to the exhibit. Baseline documentation for a small company had ping round trip time statistics of 36/97/132 between hosts H1 and H3. Today the network administrator checked connectivity by pinging between hosts H1 and H3 that resulted in a round trip time of 1458/2390/6066. What does this indicate to the network administrator?",
    "questionText": "",
    "answersDescription": "Ping round trip time statistics are shown in milliseconds. The larger the number the more delay. A baseline is critical in times of slow performance. By looking at the documentation for the performance when the network is performing fine and comparing it to information when there is a problem, a network administrator can resolve problems faster.",

    "questionText": "",
    "answersDescription": "The purpose of an ARP request is to find the MAC address of the destination host on an Ethernet LAN. The ARP process sends a Layer 2 broadcast to all devices on the Ethernet LAN. The frame contains the IP address of the destination and the broadcast MAC address, FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. The host with the IP address that matches the IP address in the ARP request will reply with a unicast frame that includes the MAC address of the host. Thus the original sending host will obtain the destination IP and MAC address pair to continue the encapsulation process for data transmission.",
