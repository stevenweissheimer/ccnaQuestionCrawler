<p><strong>1. Which design feature will limit the size of a failure domain in an enterprise network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the purchase of enterprise equipment that is designed for large traffic volume</li>
<li>the installation of redundant power supplies</li>
<li>the use of a collapsed core design</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the use of the building switch block approach</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In order to best limit the of a failure domain, routers or multilayer switches can be deployed in pairs. The failure of a single device should not cause the network to go down. Installing redundant power supplies may protect a single device from a power failure, but if that device suffers from another type of problem, a redundant device would have been a better solution. Purchasing enterprise equipment that handles large flows of traffic will not provide extra reliability in times of an outage. If a collapsed core design is used, the core and distribution are collapsed into a single device, increasing the chance of a devastating outage.</p></div>
<p><strong>2. Which two things should a network administrator modify on a router to perform password recovery? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the system image file</li>
<li>the NVRAM file system</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the configuration register value</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the startup configuration file</span></strong></li>
<li>system ROM</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. What type of network uses one common infrastructure to carry voice, data, and video signals?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>borderless</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">converged</span></strong></li>
<li>managed</li>
<li>switched</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A converged network has only one physical network to install and manage. This results in substantial savings over the installation and management of separate voice, video, and data networks.</p></div>
<p><strong>4. What are three advantages of using private IP addresses and NAT? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">hides private LAN addressing from outside devices that are connected to the Internet</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">permits LAN expansion without additional public IP addresses</span></strong></li>
<li>reduces CPU usage on customer routers</li>
<li>creates multiple public IP addresses</li>
<li>improves the performance of the router that is connected to the Internet</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">conserves registered public IP addresses</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Private IP addresses are designed to be exclusively used for internal networks and they cannot be used on the Internet. Thus they are not visible directly from the Internet and they can be used freely by network administrators for internal networks. In order for the internal hosts to access the Internet, NAT is used to translate between private and public IP addresses. NAT takes an internal private IP address and translates it to a global public IP address before the packet is forwarded.</p></div>
<p><strong>5. Which two scenarios are examples of remote access VPNs? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All users at a large branch office can access company resources through a single VPN connection.</li>
<li>A small branch office with three employees has a Cisco ASA that is used to create a VPN connection to the HQ.</li>
<li>A toy manufacturer has a permanent VPN connection to one of its parts suppliers.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A mobile sales agent is connecting to the company network via the Internet connection at a hotel.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">An employee who is working from home uses VPN client software on a laptop in order to connect to the company network.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Remote access VPNs connect individual users to another network via a VPN client that is installed on the user device. Site-to-site VPNs are “always on” connections that use VPN gateways to connect two sites together. Users at each site can access the network on the other site without having to use any special clients or configurations on their individual devices.</p></div>
<p><strong>6. What are three benefits of cloud computing? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>All routers have the same neighbor table.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">All routers are in the backbone area.</span></strong></li>
<li>All routers have the same routing table.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. What is a WAN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a network infrastructure that spans a limited physical area such as a city</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a large geographic area</span></strong></li>
<li>a network infrastructure that provides access in a small geographic area</li>
<li>a network infrastructure designed to provide data storage, retrieval, and replication</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. A network administrator has been tasked with creating a disaster recovery plan. As part of this plan, the administrator is looking for a backup site for all of the data on the company servers. What service or technology would support this requirement?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>data center</strong></span></li>
<li>virtualization</li>
<li>dedicated servers</li>
<li>software defined networking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. Which type of OSPF packet is used by a router to discover neighbor routers and establish neighbor adjacency?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>link-state update</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">hello</span></strong></li>
<li>database description</li>
<li>link-state request</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. Which two statements are characteristics of a virus? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A virus has an enabling vulnerability, a propagation mechanism, and a payload.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A virus can be dormant and then activate at a specific time or date.</span></strong></li>
<li>A virus provides the attacker with sensitive data, such as passwords.</li>
<li>A virus replicates itself by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A virus typically requires end-user activation.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>The type of end user interaction required to launch a virus is typically opening an application, opening a web page, or powering on the computer. Once activated, a virus may infect other files located on the computer or other computers on the same network.</p></div>
<p><strong>12. Which public WAN access technology utilizes copper telephone lines to provide access to subscribers that are multiplexed into a single T3 link connection?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ISDN</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">DSL</span></strong></li>
<li>cable</li>
<li>dialup</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. A customer needs a metropolitan area WAN connection that provides high-speed, dedicated bandwidth between two sites. Which type of WAN connection would best fulfill this need?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>packet-switched network</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethernet WAN</span></strong></li>
<li>circuit-switched network</li>
<li>MPLS</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> MPLS can use a variety of underlying technologies such as T- and E-Carriers, Carrier Ethernet, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL, all of which support lower speeds than an Ethernet WAN. Neither a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN), nor a packet-switched network, is considered high speed.</p></div>
<p><strong>14. A company has contracted with a network security firm to help identify the vulnerabilities of the corporate network. The firm sends a team to perform penetration tests to the company network. Why would the team use debuggers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to detect installed tools within files and directories that provide threat actors remote access and control over a computer or network</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to reverse engineer binary files when writing exploits and when analyzing malware</span></strong></li>
<li>to obtain specially designed operating systems preloaded with tools optimized for hacking</li>
<li>to detect any evidence of a hack or malware in a computer or network</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15. Consider the following output for an ACL that has been applied to a router via the access-class in command. What can a network administrator determine from the output that is shown?</strong></p>
<pre>R1#

Standard IP access list 2

10 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255 (2 matches)

20 deny any (1 match)</pre>
<ul>
<li>Two devices connected to the router have IP addresses of 192.168.10. x .</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two devices were able to use SSH or Telnet to gain access to the router.</span></strong></li>
<li>Traffic from one device was not allowed to come into one router port and be routed outbound a different router port.</li>
<li>Traffic from two devices was allowed to enter one router port and be routed outbound to a different router port.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The access-class command is used only on VTY ports. VTY ports support Telnet and/or SSH traffic. The match permit ACE is how many attempts were allowed using the VTY ports. The match deny ACE shows that a device from a network other than 192.168.10.0 was not allowed to access the router through the VTY ports.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. What command would be used as part of configuring NAT or PAT to clear dynamic entries before the timeout has expired?</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>clear access-list counters</li>
<li>clear ip pat statistics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17. What are two characteristics of video traffic? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Video traffic consumes less network resources than voice traffic consumes.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Video traffic latency should not exceed 400 ms.</span></strong></li>
<li>Video traffic is more resilient to loss than voice traffic is.</li>
<li>Video traffic requires a minimum of 30 kbs of bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Video traffic is unpredictable and inconsistent.</span></strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The first two lines of the ACL allow host 10.0.70.23 FTP access to the server that has the IP address of 10.0.54.5. The next line of the ACL allows HTTP access to the server from any host that has an IP address that starts with the number 10. The fourth line of the ACL denies any other type of traffic to the server from any source IP address. The last line of the ACL permits anything else in case there are other servers or devices added to the 10.0.54.0/28 network. Because traffic is being filtered from all other locations and for the 10.0.70.23 host device, the best place to put this ACL is closest to the server.</p></div>
<p><strong>28. Refer to the exhibit. If the network administrator created a standard ACL that allows only devices that connect to the R2 G0/0 network access to the devices on the R1 G0/1 interface, how should the ACL be applied?</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26984 size-full" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/i282157v1n1_282156.png" alt="" width="663" height="367" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/i282157v1n1_282156.png 663w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/i282157v1n1_282156-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>

<ul>
<li>The enable secret password is not configured on R1.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>The IT group network is included in the deny statement.</strong></span></li>
<li>The permit ACE specifies a wrong port number.</li>
<li>The permit ACE should specify protocol ip instead of tcp.</li>
<li>The login command has not been entered for vty lines.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The source IP range in the deny ACE is 192.168.20.0 0.0.3.255, which covers IP addresses from 192.168.20.0 to 192.168.23.255. The IT group network 192.168.22.0/28 is included in the 192.168.20/22 network. Therefore, the connection is denied. To fix it, the order of the deny and permit ACE should be switched.</p></div>
<p><strong>33. What functionality does mGRE provide to the DMVPN technology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>It allows the creation of dynamically allocated tunnels through a permanent tunnel source at the hub and dynamically allocated tunnel destinations at the spokes.</strong></span></li>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>NAT-POOL2 is not bound to ACL 1.</strong></span></li>
<li>Interface Fa0/0 should be identified as an outside NAT interface.</li>
<li>The NAT pool is incorrect.</li>
<li>Access-list 1 is misconfigured.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> R1 has to have NAT-POOL2 bound to ACL 1. This is accomplished with the command R1(config)#ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT-POOL2. This would enable the router to check for all interesting traffic and if it matches ACL 1 it would be translated by use of the addresses in NAT-POOL2.<br />
</p></div>

<li>Extreme quantities of data are sent to a particular network device interface.</li>
<li>Too much information is destined for a particular memory block, causing additional memory areas to be affecte</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A Trojan horse carries out malicious operations under the guise of a legitimate program. Denial of service attacks send extreme quantities of data to a particular host or network device interface. Password attacks use electronic dictionaries in an attempt to learn passwords. Buffer overflow attacks exploit memory buffers by sending too much information to a host to render the system inoperable.</p></div>
<p><strong>44. An attacker is redirecting traffic to a false default gateway in an attempt to intercept the data traffic of a switched network. What type of attack could achieve this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TCP SYN flood</li>
<li>DNS tunneling</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DHCP spoofing</strong></span></li>
<li>ARP cache poisoning</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In DHCP spoofing attacks, an attacker configures a fake DHCP server on the network to issue DHCP addresses to clients with the aim of forcing the clients to use a false default gateway, and other false services. DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that can mitigate DHCP attacks. MAC address starvation and MAC address snooping are not recognized security attacks. MAC address spoofing is a network security threat.</p></div>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>origin authentication</strong></span></li>
<li>data confidentiality</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Secure communications consists of four elements:<br />
Data confidentiality &#8211; guarantees that only authorized users can read the message<br />
Data integrity &#8211; guarantees that the message was not altered<br />
Origin authentication &#8211; guarantees that the message is not a forgery and does actually come from whom it states<br />
Data nonrepudiation – guarantees that the sender cannot repudiate, or refute, the validity of a message sent</p></div>
<p><strong>46. A company has contracted with a network security firm to help identify the vulnerabilities of the corporate network. The firm sends a team to perform penetration tests to the company network. Why would the team use packet sniffers? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to detect installed tools within files and directories that provide threat actors remote access and control over a computer or network</li>
<li>to detect any evidence of a hack or malware in a computer or network</li>

<p><strong>50. What is one reason to use the ip ospf priority command when the OSPF routing protocol is in use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to activate the OSPF neighboring process</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to influence the DR/BDR election process</strong></span></li>
<li>to provide a backdoor for connectivity during the convergence process</li>
<li>to streamline and speed up the convergence process</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The OSPF priority can be set to a number between 0 and 255. The higher the number set, the more likely the router becomes the DR. A priority 0 stops a router from participating in the election process and the router does not become a DR or a BDR.</p></div>
<p><strong>51. An ACL is applied inbound on a router interface. The ACL consists of a single entry:</strong></p>
<pre>access-list 210 permit tcp 172.18.20.0 0.0.0.31 172.18.20.32 0.0.0.31 eq ftp .</pre>
<p><strong>If a packet with a source address of 172.18.20.14, a destination address of 172.18.20.40, and a protocol of 21 is received on the interface, is the packet permitted or denied?</strong></p>

Authentication &#8211; IPsec uses Internet Key Exchange (IKE) to authenticate users and devices that can carry out communication independently. IKE uses several types of authentication, including username and password, one-time password, biometrics, pre-shared keys (PSKs), and digital certificates.<br />
Secure key exchange- IPsec uses the Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm to provide a public key exchange method for two peers to establish a shared secret key.</p></div>
<p><strong>68. In a large enterprise network, which two functions are performed by routers at the distribution layer? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>connect users to the network</li>
<li>provide a high-speed network backbone</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">connect remote networks</span></strong></li>
<li>provide Power over Ethernet to devices</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>provide data traffic security</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a large enterprise network, the provision of a high-speed network backbone is a function of the core layer. Access layer switches connect users to the network and provide Power over Ethernet to devices. Distribution layer routers provide data traffic security and connections to other networks.</p></div>
<p><strong>69. Which two statements describe the use of asymmetric algorithms? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Public and private keys may be used interchangeably.</li>
<li>If a public key is used to encrypt the data, a public key must be used to decrypt the data.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If a private key is used to encrypt the data, a public key must be used to decrypt the data.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If a public key is used to encrypt the data, a private key must be used to decrypt the data.</span></strong></li>
<li>If a private key is used to encrypt the data, a private key must be used to decrypt the data.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Asymmetric algorithms use two keys: a public key and a private key. Both keys are capable of the encryption process, but the complementary matched key is required for decryption. If a public key encrypts the data, the matching private key decrypts the data. The opposite is also true. If a private key encrypts the data, the corresponding public key decrypts the data.</p></div>
<p><strong>70. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator has deployed QoS and has configured the network to mark traffic on the VoIP phones as well as the Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches. Where should initial marking occur to establish the trust boundary?</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26681 size-full" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i290000v1n1_Trust-Boundary2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="317" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i290000v1n1_Trust-Boundary2.jpg 600w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i290000v1n1_Trust-Boundary2-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<li>Trust Boundary 4</li>
<li>Trust Boundary 3</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Trust Boundary 1</strong></span></li>
<li>Trust Boundary 2</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Traffic should be classified and marked as close to its source as possible. The trust boundary identifies at which device marked traffic should be trusted. Traffic marked on VoIP phones would be considered trusted as it moves into the enterprise network.</p></div>
<p><strong>71. What are two benefits of extending access layer connectivity to users through a wireless medium? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">reduced costs</span></strong></li>
<li>decreased number of critical points of failure</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>increased flexibility</strong></span></li>
<li>increased bandwidth availability</li>
<li>increased network management options</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Wireless connectivity at the access layer provides increased flexibility, reduced costs, and the ability to grow and adapt to changing business requirements. Utilizing wireless routers and access points can provide an increase in the number of central points of failure. Wireless routers and access points will not provide an increase in bandwidth availability.</p></div>
<p><strong>72. What are two purposes of launching a reconnaissance attack on a network? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to scan for accessibility</span></strong></li>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to gather information about the network and devices</strong></span></li>
<li>to prevent other users from accessing the system</li>
<li>to escalate access privileges</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Gathering information about a network and scanning for access is a reconnaissance attack. Preventing other users from accessing a system is a denial of service attack. Attempting to retrieve and modify data, and attempting to escalate access privileges are types of access attacks.</p></div>
<p><strong>73. A group of users on the same network are all complaining about their computers running slowly. After investigating, the technician determines that these computers are part of a zombie network. Which type of malware is used to control these computers?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The common data formats that are used in many applications including network automation and programmability are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</strong> &#8211; In JSON, the data known as an object is one or more key/value pairs enclosed in braces { }. Keys must be strings within double quotation marks &#8221; &#8220;. Keys and values are separated by a colon.</li>
<li><strong>eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</strong> &#8211; In XML, the data is enclosed within a related set of tags &lt;tag&gt;data&lt;/tag&gt;.</li>
<li><strong>YAML Ain’t Markup Language (YAML)</strong> &#8211; In YAML, the data known as an object is one or more key value pairs. Key value pairs are separated by a colon without the use of quotation marks. YAML uses indentation to define its structure, without the use of brackets or commas.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>77. What QoS step must occur before packets can be marked?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">classifying</span></strong></li>
<li>shaping</li>
<li>queuing</li>
<li>policing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>78. What is the main function of a hypervisor?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is used to create and manage multiple VM instances on a host machine.</span></strong></li>
<li>It is a device that filters and checks security credentials.</li>
<li>It is a device that synchronizes a group of sensors.</li>

<p><strong>79. A company needs to interconnect several branch offices across a metropolitan area. The network engineer is seeking a solution that provides high-speed converged traffic, including voice, video, and data on the same network infrastructure. The company also wants easy integration to their existing LAN infrastructure in their office locations. Which technology should be recommended?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frame Relay</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethernet WAN</span></strong></li>
<li>VSAT</li>
<li>ISDN</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ethernet WAN uses many Ethernet standards and it connects easily to existing Ethernet LANs. It provides a switched, high-bandwidth Layer 2 network capable of managing data, voice, and video all on the same infrastructure. ISDN, while capable of supporting both voice and data, does not provide high bandwidth. VSAT uses satellite connectivity to establish a private WAN connection but with relatively low bandwidth. Use of VSAT, ISDN, and Frame Relay require specific network devices for the WAN connection and data conversion between LAN and WAN.</p></div>
<p><strong>80. Refer to the exhibit. As traffic is forwarded out an egress interface with QoS treatment, which congestion avoidance technique is used?</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-30381 size-full" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i288031v1n1_Traffic_Policing.png" alt="" width="521" height="164" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i288031v1n1_Traffic_Policing.png 521w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i288031v1n1_Traffic_Policing-300x94.png 300w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/i288031v1n1_Traffic_Policing-20x6.png 20w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>traffic shaping</li>
<li>weighted random early detection</li>
<li>classification and marking</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>traffic policing</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Traffic shaping buffers excess packets in a queue and then forwards the traffic over increments of time, which creates a smoothed packet output rate. Traffic policing drops traffic when the amount of traffic reaches a configured maximum rate, which creates an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.</p></div>
<p><strong>81. An ACL is applied inbound on a router interface. The ACL consists of a single entry:</strong></p>
<pre>access-list 101 permit tcp 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.3.8 eq dns .</pre>
<p><strong>If a packet with a source address of 10.1.3.8, a destination address of 10.10.3.8, and a protocol of 53 is received on the interface, is the packet permitted or denied?</strong></p>

Extended IP access list 101<br />
5 permit tcp any any eq ssh<br />
10 deny tcp any any<br />
20 deny udp any any<br />
30 permit icmp any any<br />
So, only SSH packets and ICMP packets will be permitted.​</p></div>
<p><strong>85. Which troubleshooting approach is more appropriate for a seasoned network administrator rather than a less-experienced network administrator?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>a less-structured approach based on an educated guess</strong></span></li>
<li>an approach comparing working and nonworking components to spot significant differences</li>
<li>a structured approach starting with the physical layer and moving up through the layers of the OSI model until the cause of the problem is identified</li>
<li>an approach that starts with the end-user applications and moves down through the layers of the OSI model until the cause of the problem has been identified</li>

<ul>
<li>The inside and outside NAT interlaces have been configured backwards</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The inside global address is not on the same subnet as the ISP</strong></span></li>
<li>The address on Fa0/0 should be 64.100.0.1.</li>
<li>The NAT source access list matches the wrong address range.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The output of debug ip nat shows each packet that is translated by the router. The “s” is the source IP address of the packet and the “d” is the destination. The address after the arrow (“-&gt;”) shows the translated address. In this case, the translated address is on the 209.165.201.0 subnet but the ISP facing interface is in the 209.165.200.224/27 subnet. The ISP may drop the incoming packets, or might be unable to route the return packets back to the host because the address is in an unknown subnet. </p></div>
<p><strong>88. Why is QoS an important issue in a converged network that combines voice, video, and data communications?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data communications must be given the first priority.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Voice and video communications are more sensitive to latency.</span></strong></li>
<li>Legacy equipment is unable to transmit voice and video without QoS.</li>
<li>Data communications are sensitive to jitter.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Without any QoS mechanisms in place, time-sensitive packets, such as voice and video, will be dropped with the same frequency as email and web browsing traffic.</p></div>
<p><strong>89. Which statement describes a VPN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VPNs use logical connections to create public networks through the Internet.</li>
<li>VPNs use open source virtualization software to create the tunnel through the Internet.</li>
<li>VPNs use dedicated physical connections to transfer data between remote users.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">VPNs use virtual connections to create a private network through a public network.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A VPN is a private network that is created over a public network. Instead of using dedicated physical connections, a VPN uses virtual connections routed through a public network between two network devices.</p></div>
<p><strong>90. In which OSPF state is the DR/BDR election conducted?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>91. Two corporations have just completed a merger. The network engineer has been asked to connect the two corporate networks without the expense of leased lines. Which solution would be the most cost effective method of providing a proper and secure connection between the two corporate networks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco Secure Mobility Clientless SSL VPN</li>
<li>Frame Relay</li>
<li>remote access VPN using IPsec</li>
<li>Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client with SSL</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">site-to-site VPN</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The site-to-site VPN is an extension of a classic WAN network that provides a static interconnection of entire networks. Frame Relay would be a better choice than leased lines, but would be more expensive than implementing site-to-site VPNs. The other options refer to remote access VPNs which are better suited for connecting users to the corporate network versus interconnecting two or more networks.</p></div>
<p><strong>92. What is the final operational state that will form between an OSPF DR and a DROTHER once the routers reach convergence?</strong></p>

<li>Router R4 will become the DR and router R3 will become the BDR.</li>
<li>Router R1 will become the DR and router R2 will become the BDR.</li>
<li>Router R3 will become the DR and router R2 will become the BDR.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> OSPF elections of a DR are based on the following in order of precedence:</p>
<ul>
<li>highest pritority from 1 -255 (0 = never a DR)</li>
<li>highest router ID</li>
<li>highest IP address of a loopback or active interface in the absence of a manually configured router ID. Loopback IP addresses take higher precedence than other interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case routers R3 and R1 have the highest router priority. Between the two, R3 has the higher router ID. Therefore, R3 will become the DR and R1 will become the BDR.</p></div><br />

<li>supply of consistent air flow</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>support of live migration</strong></span></li>
<li>guarantee of power</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Live migration allows moving of one virtual server to another virtual server that could be in a different location that is some distance from the original data center.</p></div><br />
<strong>Case 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Less energy is consumed.</li>
<li>Server provisioning is faster.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hardware at the recovery site does not have to be identical to production equipment.</strong></span></li>
<li>Power is always provided.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Improved disaster recovery &#8211; Virtualization offers advanced business continuity solutions. It provides hardware abstraction capability so that the recovery site no longer needs to have hardware that is identical to the hardware in the production environment. Most enterprise server virtualization platforms also have software that can help test and automate the failover before a disaster does happen.</p></div>
<p><strong>107. How does virtualization help with disaster recovery within a data center?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Hardware does not have to be identical.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>(Other case) Hardware at the recovery site does not have to be identical to production equipment.</strong></span></li>
<li>Power is always provided.</li>
<li>Less energy is consumed.</li>
<li>Server provisioning is faster.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Disaster recovery is how a company goes about accessing applications, data, and the hardware that might be affected during a disaster. Virtualization provides hardware independence which means the disaster recovery site does not have to have the exact equipment as the equipment in production. Server provisioning is relevant when a server is built for the first time. Although data centers do have backup generators, the entire data center is designed for disaster recovery. One particular data center could never guarantee that the data center itself would never be without power.</p></div>

<p><strong>143. Which three statements are generally considered to be best practices in the placement of ACLs? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Filter unwanted traffic before it travels onto a low-bandwidth link.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Place standard ACLs close to the destination IP address of the traffic.</span></strong></li>
<li>Place standard ACLs close to the source IP address of the traffic.</li>
<li>Place extended ACLs close to the destination IP address of the traffic.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Place extended ACLs close to the source IP address of the traffic.</span></strong></li>
<li>For every inbound ACL placed on an interface, there should be a matching outbound ACL.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Extended ACLs should be placed as close as possible to the source IP address, so that traffic that needs to be filtered does not cross the network and use network resources. Because standard ACLs do not specify a destination address, they should be placed as close to the destination as possible. Placing a standard ACL close to the source may have the effect of filtering all traffic, and limiting services to other hosts. Filtering unwanted traffic before it enters low-bandwidth links preserves bandwidth and supports network functionality. Decisions on placing ACLs inbound or outbound are dependent on the requirements to be met.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Standard ACLs permit or deny packets based only on the source IPv4 address. Because all traffic types are permitted or denied, standard ACLs should be located as close to the destination as possible.</p>
<p>Extended ACLs permit or deny packets based on the source IPv4 address and destination IPv4 address, protocol type, source and destination TCP or UDP ports and more. Because the filtering of extended ACLs is so specific, extended ACLs should be located as close as possible to the source of the traffic to be filtered. Undesirable traffic is denied close to the source network without crossing the network infrastructure.</p></div>
