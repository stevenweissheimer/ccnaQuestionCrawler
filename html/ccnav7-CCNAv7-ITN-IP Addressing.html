The company design document indicates that the subnet portion of the IPv6 addresses is used for the new hierarchical network design, with the s ite subsection to represent multiple geographical sites of the company, the s ub-site section to represent multiple campuses at each site, and the s ubnet section to indicate each network segment separated by routers. With such a scheme, what is the maximum number of subnets achieved per sub-site ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0</li>
<li>4</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong></li>
<li>256</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Because only one hexadecimal character is used to represent the subnet, that one character can represent 16 different values 0 through F.</p></div>
<p><strong>29. What is used in the EUI-64 process to create an IPv6 interface ID on an IPv6 enabled interface?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the MAC address of the IPv6 enabled interface</span></strong></li>
<li>a randomly generated 64-bit hexadecimal address</li>
<li>an IPv6 address that is provided by a DHCPv6 server</li>
<li>an IPv4 address that is configured on the interface</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The EUI-64 process uses the MAC address of an interface to construct an interface ID (IID). Because the MAC address is only 48 bits in length, 16 additional bits (FF:FE) must be added to the MAC address to create the full 64-bit interface ID.</p></div>
<p><strong>30. What is the prefix for the host address 2001:DB8:BC15:A:12AB::1/64?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2001:DB8:BC15</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2001:DB8:BC15:A</span></strong></li>
<li>2001:DB8:BC15:A:1</li>
<li>2001:DB8:BC15:A:12</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The network portion, or prefix, of an IPv6 address is identified through the prefix length. A /64 prefix length indicates that the first 64 bits of the IPv6 address is the network portion. Hence the prefix is 2001:DB8:BC15:A.</p></div>
<p><strong>31. An IPv6 enabled device sends a data packet with the destination address of FF02::1. What is the target of this packet?​</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the one IPv6 device on the link that has been uniquely configured with this address</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">all IPv6 enabled devices on the local link​ or network</span></strong></li>
<li>only IPv6 DHCP servers​</li>
<li>only IPv6 configured routers</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> This address is one of the assigned IPv6 multicast addresses. Packets addressed to FF02::1 are for all IPv6 enabled devices on the link or network. FF02::2 is for all IPv6 routers that exist on the network.</p></div>
<p><strong>32. Match the IPv6 address with the IPv6 address type. (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> FF02::1:FFAE:F85F is a solicited node multicast address.<br />
2001:DB8::BAF:3F57:FE94 is a global unicast address.<br />
FF02::1 is the all node multicast address. Packets sent to this address will be received by all IPv6 hosts on the local link.<br />
::1 is the IPv6 loopback address.<br />
There are no examples of link local or unique local addresses provided. </p></div>
<p><strong>33. Which IPv6 prefix is reserved for communication between devices on the same link?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FC00::/7</li>
<li>2001::/32</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">FE80::/10</span></strong></li>
<li>FDFF::/7</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> IPv6 link-local unicast addresses are in the FE80::/10 prefix range and are not routable. They are used only for communications between devices on the same link.</p></div>
<p><strong>34. Which type of IPv6 address refers to any unicast address that is assigned to multiple hosts?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unique local</li>
<li>global unicast</li>
<li>link-local</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">anycast</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The IPv6 specifications include anycast addresses. An anycast address is any unicast IPv6 address that is assigned to multiple devices.</p></div>
<p><strong>35. What are two types of IPv6 unicast addresses? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>multicast</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>loopback</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>link-local</strong></span></li>
<li>anycast</li>
<li>broadcast</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Multicast, anycast, and unicast are types of IPv6 addresses. There is no broadcast address in IPv6. Loopback and link-local are specific types of unicast addresses.</p></div>
<p><strong>36. Which service provides dynamic global IPv6 addressing to end devices without using a server that keeps a record of available IPv6 addresses?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>stateful DHCPv6</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SLAAC</span></strong></li>
<li>static IPv6 addressing</li>
<li>stateless DHCPv6</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), a PC can solicit a router and receive the prefix length of the network. From this information the PC can then create its own IPv6 global unicast address.</p></div>
<p><strong>37. Which protocol supports Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for dynamic assignment of IPv6 addresses to a host?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ARPv6</li>
<li>DHCPv6</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ICMPv6</span></strong></li>
<li>UDP</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> SLAAC uses ICMPv6 messages when dynamically assigning an IPv6 address to a host. DHCPv6 is an alternate method of assigning an IPv6 addresses to a host. ARPv6 does not exist. Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) provides the functionality of ARP for IPv6 networks. UDP is the transport layer protocol used by DHCPv6.</p></div>
<p><strong>38. Three methods allow IPv6 and IPv4 to co-exist. Match each method with its description. (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SNMP</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ICMP</span></strong></li>
<li>Telnet</li>
<li>TCP</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Traceroute uses the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to send and receive echo-request and echo-reply messages.</p></div>
<p><strong>42. Which ICMPv6 message is sent when the IPv6 hop limit field of a packet is decremented to zero and the packet cannot be forwarded?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>network unreachable</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">time exceeded</span></strong></li>
<li>protocol unreachable</li>
<li>port unreachable</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> ICMPv6 uses the hop limit field in the IPv6 packet header to determine if the packet has expired. If the hop limit field has reached zero, a router will send a time exceeded message back towards the source indicating that the router cannot forward the packet.</p></div>
<p><strong>43. A user executes a traceroute over IPv6. At what point would a router in the path to the destination device drop the packet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>when the value of the Hop Limit field reaches 255</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">when the value of the Hop Limit field reaches zero</span></strong></li>
<li>when the router receives an ICMP time exceeded message</li>
<li>when the target host responds with an ICMP echo reply message</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a traceroute is performed, the value in the Hop Limit field of an IPv6 packet determines how many router hops the packet can travel. Once the Hop Limit field reaches a value of zero, it can no longer be forwarded and the receiving router will drop the packet.</p></div>
<p><strong>44. What is the purpose of ICMP messages?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to inform routers about network topology changes</li>
<li>to ensure the delivery of an IP packet</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to provide feedback of IP packet transmissions</span></strong></li>
<li>to monitor the process of a domain name to IP address resolution</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The purpose of ICMP messages is to provide feedback about issues that are related to the processing of IP packets.</p></div>
<p><strong>45. What source IP address does a router use by default when the traceroute command is issued?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the highest configured IP address on the router</li>
<li>a loopback IP address</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the IP address of the outbound interface</span></strong></li>
<li>the lowest configured IP address on the router</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When sending an echo request message, a router will use the IP address of the exit interface as the source IP address. This default behavior can be changed by using an extended ping and specifying a specific source IP address.</p></div>
<p><strong>46. Match each description with an appropriate IP address. (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>
