<p><strong>6. An employee at a branch office is creating a quote for a customer. In order to do this, the employee needs to access confidential pricing information from internal servers at the Head Office. What type of network would the employee access?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>an intranet</strong></span></li>
<li>the Internet</li>
<li>an extranet</li>
<li>a local area network</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Intranet is a term used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization&#8217;s members, employees, or others with authorization.</p></div><br />
<strong>7. Which statement describes the use of powerline networking technology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New “smart” electrical cabling is used to extend an existing home LAN.</li>
<li>A home LAN is installed without the use of physical cabling.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A device connects to an existing home LAN using an adapter and an existing electrical outlet.</span></strong></li>
<li>Wireless access points use powerline adapters to distribute data through the home LAN.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Powerline networking adds the ability to connect a device to the network using an adapter wherever there is an electrical outlet.​ The network uses existing electrical wiring to send data. It is not a replacement for physical cabling, but it can add functionality in places where wireless access points cannot be used or cannot reach devices.​</p></div>
<p><strong>8. A networking technician is working on the wireless network at a medical clinic. The technician accidentally sets up the wireless network so that patients can see the medical records data of other patients.

<li>scalability</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>security</strong></span></li>
<li>Quality of Service (QoS)</li>
<li>reliability</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Network security includes protecting the confidentiality of data that is on the network. In this case, because confidential data has been made available to unauthorized users, the security characteristic of the network has failed.</p></div>
<p><strong>9. Match each characteristic to its corresponding Internet connectivity type. (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_70871" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70871" class="size-full wp-image-70871" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2021-09-13_105339.jpg" alt="ITN (Version 7.00) - Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam 5" width="724" height="540" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2021-09-13_105339.jpg 724w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2021-09-13_105339-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70871" class="wp-caption-text">ITN (Version 7.00) &#8211; Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam 5</p></div>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> DSL is an always-on, high bandwidth connection that runs over telephone lines. Cable uses the same coaxial cable that carries television signals into the home to provide Internet access. Dialup telephone is much slower than either DSL or cable, but is the least expensive option for home users because it can use any telephone line and a simple modem. Satellite requires a clear line of sight and is affected by trees and other obstructions. None of these typical home options use dedicated leased lines such as T1/E1 and T3/E3.</p></div>
<p><strong>10. What two criteria are used to help select a network medium from various network media? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the types of data that need to be prioritized</li>
<li>the cost of the end devices utilized in the network</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the distance the selected medium can successfully carry a signal</span></strong></li>
<li>the number of intermediate devices installed in the network</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the environment where the selected medium is to be installed</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Criteria for choosing a network medium are the distance the selected medium can successfully carry a signal, the environment in which the selected medium is to be installed, the amount of data and the speed at which the data must be transmitted, and the cost of the medium and its installation.</p></div>
<p><strong>11. What type of network traffic requires QoS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>email</li>
<li>on-line purchasing</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">video conferencing</span></strong></li>

<p><strong>12. A user is implementing security on a small office network. Which two actions would provide the minimum security requirements for this network? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>implementing a firewall</strong></span></li>
<li>installing a wireless network</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>installing antivirus software</strong></span></li>
<li>implementing an intrusion detection system</li>
<li>adding a dedicated intrusion prevention device</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Technically complex security measures such as intrusion prevention and intrusion prevention systems are usually associated with business networks rather than home networks. Installing antivirus software, antimalware software, and implementing a firewall will usually be the minimum requirements for home networks. Installing a home wireless network will not improve network security, and will require further security actions to be taken.</p></div>
<p><strong>13. Passwords can be used to restrict access to all or parts of the Cisco IOS. Select the modes and interfaces that can be protected with passwords. (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>VTY interface</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>console interface</strong></span></li>
<li>Ethernet interface</li>
<li>boot IOS mode</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>privileged EXEC mode</strong></span></li>
<li>router configuration mode</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Access to the VTY and console interfaces can be restricted using passwords. Out-of-band management of the router can be restricted in both user EXEC and privileged EXEC modes.</p></div><br />
<strong>14. Which interface allows remote management of a Layer 2 switch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the AUX interface</li>
<li>the console port interface</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the switch virtual interface</strong></span></li>
<li>the first Ethernet port interface</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a Layer 2 switch, there is a switch virtual interface (SVI) that provides a means for remotely managing the device.</p></div>
<p><strong>15. What function does pressing the Tab key have when entering a command in IOS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It aborts the current command and returns to configuration mode.</li>
<li>It exits configuration mode and returns to user EXEC mode.</li>
<li>It moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It completes the remainder of a partially typed word in a command.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Pressing the Tab key after a command has been partially typed will cause the IOS to complete the rest of the command.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. While trying to solve a network issue, a technician made multiple changes to the current router configuration file. The changes did not solve the problem and were not saved. What action can the technician take to discard the changes and work with the file in NVRAM?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Issue the reload command without saving the running configuration.</span></strong></li>
<li>Delete the vlan.dat file and reboot the device.</li>
<li>Close and reopen the terminal emulation software.</li>
<li>Issue the copy startup-config running-config command.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The technician does not want to make any mistakes trying to remove all the changes that were done to the running configuration file. The solution is to reboot the router without saving the running configuration. The copy startup-config running-config command does not overwrite the running configuration file with the configuration file stored in NVRAM, but rather it just has an additive effect.</p></div>
<p><strong>17. An administrator uses the Ctrl-Shift-6 key combination on a switch after issuing the ping command. What is the purpose of using these keystrokes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to restart the ping process</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to interrupt the ping process</span></strong></li>
<li>to exit to a different configuration mode</li>
<li>to allow the user to complete the command</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To interrupt an IOS process such as ping or traceroute, a user enters the Ctrl-Shift-6 key combination. Tab completes the remainder of parameters or arguments within a command. To exit from configuration mode to privileged mode use the Ctrl-Z keystroke. CTRL-R will redisplay the line just typed, thus making it easier for the user to press Enter and reissue the ping command.</p></div><br />
<strong>18. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring access control to switch SW1. If the administrator uses a console connection to connect to the switch, which password is needed to access user EXEC mode?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_37737" style="width: 497px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37737" class="size-full wp-image-37737" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic-Network-Connectivity-and-Communications-Exam-Answers-14.jpg" alt="CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam Answers 14" width="487" height="235" /><p id="caption-attachment-37737" class="wp-caption-text">CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam Answers 14</p></div>

<li>secretin</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">lineconin</span></strong></li>
<li>linevtyin</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Telnet accesses a network device through the virtual interface configured with the line VTY command. The password configured under this is required to access the user EXEC mode. The password configured under the line console 0 command is required to gain entry through the console port, and the enable and enable secret passwords are used to allow entry into the privileged EXEC mode.</p></div>
<p><strong>19. A technician configures a switch with these commands:</strong></p>
<pre>SwitchA(config)# interface vlan 1

SwitchA(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

SwitchA(config-if)# no shutdown</pre>
<p><strong>What is the technician configuring?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Telnet access</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SVI</span></strong></li>
<li>password encryption</li>
<li>physical switchport access</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For a switch to have an IP address, a switch virtual interface must be configured. This allows the switch to be managed remotely over the network.</p></div>
<p><strong>20. Which command or key combination allows a user to return to the previous level in the command hierarchy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>end</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">exit</span></strong></li>
<li>Ctrl-Z</li>
<li>Ctrl-C</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> End and CTRL-Z return the user to the privileged EXEC mode. Ctrl-C ends a command in process. The exit command returns the user to the previous level.</p></div>
<p><strong>21. What are two characteristics of RAM on a Cisco device? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RAM provides nonvolatile storage.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The configuration that is actively running on the device is stored in RAM.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The contents of RAM are lost during a power cycle.</strong></span></li>
<li>RAM is a component in Cisco switches but not in Cisco routers.</li>
<li>RAM is able to store multiple versions of IOS and configuration files.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> RAM stores data that is used by the device to support network operations. The running configuration is stored in RAM. This type of memory is considered volatile memory because data is lost during a power cycle. Flash memory stores the IOS and delivers a copy of the IOS into RAM when a device is powered on. Flash memory is nonvolatile since it retains stored contents during a loss of power.</p></div><br />
<strong>22. Which two host names follow the guidelines for naming conventions on Cisco IOS devices? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Branch2!</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RM-3-Switch-2A4</span></strong></li>
<li>Floor(15)</li>
<li>HO Floor 17</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SwBranch799</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Some guidelines for naming conventions are that names should:<br />
Start with a letter<br />
Contain no spaces<br />
End with a letter or digit<br />
Use only letters, digits, and dashes<br />
Be less than 64 characters in length</p></div>
<p><strong>23. How is SSH different from Telnet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SSH makes connections over the network, whereas Telnet is for out-of-band access.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SSH provides security to remote sessions by encrypting messages and using user authentication. Telnet is considered insecure and sends messages in plaintext.</span></strong></li>
<li>SSH requires the use of the PuTTY terminal emulation program. Tera Term must be used to connect to devices through the use of Telnet.</li>
<li>SSH must be configured over an active network connection, whereas Telnet is used to connect to a device from a console connection.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> SSH is the preferred protocol for connecting to a device operating system over the network because it is much more secure than Telnet. Both SSH and Telnet are used to connect to devices over the network, and so are both used in-band. PuTTY and Terra Term can be used to make both SSH and Telnet connections.</p></div>
<p><strong>24. An administrator is configuring a switch console port with a password. In what order will the administrator travel through the IOS modes of operation in order to reach the mode in which the configuration commands will be entered? (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_37740" style="width: 742px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37740" class="size-full wp-image-37740" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic-Network-Connectivity-and-Communications-Exam-Answers-20.jpg" alt="CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam Answers 20" width="732" height="588" /><p id="caption-attachment-37740" class="wp-caption-text">CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam Answers 24</p></div>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The configuration mode that the administrator first encounters is user EXEC mode. After the <b>enable </b>command is entered, the next mode is privileged EXEC mode. From there, the<b> configure termina</b>l command is entered to move to global configuration mode. Finally, the administrator enters the<b> line console 0 </b>command to enter the mode in which the configuration will be entered.</p></div>
<p><strong>25. What are three characteristics of an SVI? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is designed as a security protocol to protect switch ports.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is not associated with any physical interface on a switch.</strong></span></li>
<li>It is a special interface that allows connectivity by different types of media.</li>
<li>It is required to allow connectivity by any device at any location.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It provides a means to remotely manage a switch.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is associated with VLAN1 by default.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Switches have one or more switch virtual interfaces (SVIs). SVIs are created in software since there is no physical hardware associated with them. Virtual interfaces provide a means to remotely manage a switch over a network that is using IP. Each switch comes with one SVI appearing in the default configuration &#8220;out-of-the-box.&#8221; The default SVI interface is VLAN1.</p></div>
<p><strong>26. What command is used to verify the condition of the switch interfaces, including the status of the interfaces and a configured IP address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ipconfig</li>
<li>ping</li>
<li>traceroute</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">show ip interface brief</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The show ip interface brief command is used to display a brief synopsis of the condition of the device interfaces. The ipconfig command is used to verify TCP/IP properties on a host. The ping command is used to verify Layer 3 connectivity. The traceroute command is used to trace the network path from source to destination.</p></div>
<p><strong>27. Match the description with the associated IOS mode. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />
<a href="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-03-08_184953.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40850" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-03-08_184953.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="691" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-03-08_184953.jpg 665w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-03-08_184953-289x300.jpg 289w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></a></p>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The shortcuts with their functions are as follows:<br />
&#8211; Tab &#8211; Completes the remainder of a partially typed command or keyword<br />
&#8211; Space bar &#8211; displays the next screen<br />
&#8211; ? &#8211; provides context-sensitive help<br />
&#8211; Up Arrow &#8211; Allows user to scroll backward through former commands<br />
&#8211; Ctrl-C &#8211; cancels any command currently being entered and returns directly to privileged EXEC mode<br />
&#8211; Ctrl-Shift-6 &#8211; Allows the user to interrupt an IOS process such as ping or traceroute</p></div></p>
<p><strong>29. In the show running-config command, which part of the syntax is represented by running-config ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the command</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a keyword</span></strong></li>
<li>a variable</li>
<li>a prompt</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The first part of the syntax, show, is the command, and the second part of the syntax, running-config, is the keyword. The keyword specifies what should be displayed as the output of the show command.</p></div>
<p><strong>30. After making configuration changes on a Cisco switch, a network administrator issues a copy running-config startup-config command. What is the result of issuing this command?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The new configuration will be stored in flash memory.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The new configuration will be loaded if the switch is restarted.</span></strong></li>
<li>The current IOS file will be replaced with the newly configured file.</li>
<li>The configuration changes will be removed and the original configuration will be restored.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> With the <code>copy running-config startup-config</code> command, the content of the current operating configuration replaces the startup configuration file stored in NVRAM. The configuration file saved in NVRAM will be loaded when the device is restarted.</p></div>
<p><strong>31. What command will prevent all unencrypted passwords from displaying in plain text in a configuration file?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(config)# enable password secret</li>
<li>(config)# enable secret Secret_Password</li>
<li>(config-line)# password secret</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(config)# service password-encryption</span></strong></li>
<li>(config)# enable secret Encrypted_Password</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To prevent all configured passwords from appearing in plain text in configuration files, an administrator can execute the service password-encryption command. This command encrypts all configured passwords in the configuration file.</p></div><br />
<strong>32. A network administrator enters the service password-encryption command into the configuration mode of a router. What does this command accomplish?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This command encrypts passwords as they are transmitted across serial WAN links.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">This command prevents someone from viewing the running configuration passwords.</span></strong></li>
<li>This command enables a strong encryption algorithm for the enable secret password command.</li>
<li>This command automatically encrypts passwords in configuration files that are currently stored in NVRAM.</li>
<li>This command provides an exclusive encrypted password for external service personnel who are required to do router maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The startup-config and running-config files display most passwords in plaintext. Use the service password-encryption global config command to encrypt all plaintext passwords in these files.</p></div>
<p><strong>33. What method can be used by two computers to ensure that packets are not dropped because too much data is being sent too quickly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>encapsulation</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">flow control</span></strong></li>
<li>access method</li>
<li>response timeout</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In order for two computers to be able to communicate effectively, there must be a mechanism that allows both the source and destination to set the timing of the transmission and receipt of data. Flow control allows for this by ensuring that data is not sent too fast for it to be received properly.</p></div>
<p><strong>34. Which statement accurately describes a TCP/IP encapsulation process when a PC is sending data to the network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is sent from the internet layer to the network access layer.</li>
<li>Packets are sent from the network access layer to the transport layer.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Segments are sent from the transport layer to the internet layer.</span></strong></li>
<li>Frames are sent from the network access layer to the internet layer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When the data is traveling from the PC to the network, the transport layer sends segments to the internet layer. The internet layer sends packets to the network access layer, which creates frames and then converts the frames to bits. The bits are released to the network media.</p></div>
<p><strong>35. What three application layer protocols are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ARP</li>

<li>packet</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">segment</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the network media. During the process, various protocols add information to it at each level. At each stage of the process, a PDU (protocol data unit) has a different name to reflect its new functions. The PDUs are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite:<br />
Data &#8211; The general term for the PDU used at the application layer.<br />
Segment &#8211; transport layer PDU<br />
Packet &#8211; network layer PDU<br />
Frame – data link layer PDU<br />
Bits &#8211; A physical layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium</p></div>
<p><strong>38. When IPv4 addressing is manually configured on a web server, which property of the IPv4 configuration identifies the network and host portion for an IPv4 address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DNS server address</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">subnet mask</span></strong></li>
<li>default gateway</li>
<li>DHCP server address</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> There are several components that need to be entered when configuring IPv4 for an end device:<br />
IPv4 address &#8211; uniquely identifies an end device on the network<br />
Subnet mask &#8211; determines the network address portion and host portion for an IPv4 address<br />
Default gateway &#8211; the IP address of the router interface used for communicating with hosts in another network<br />
DNS server address &#8211; the IP address of the Domain Name System (DNS) server<br />
DHCP server address (if DHCP is used) is not configured manually on end devices. It will be provided by a DHCP server when an end device requests an IP address.</p></div>

<li>HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet</li>
<li>Ethernet, TCP, IP, HTTP</li>
<li>HTTP, Ethernet, IP, TCP</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
1. HTTP governs the way that a web server and client interact.<br />
2. TCP manages individual conversations between web servers and clients.<br />
3. IP is responsible for delivery across the best path to the destination.<br />
4. Ethernet takes the packet from IP and formats it for transmission.</p></div>
<p><strong>46. Which two OSI model layers have the same functionality as a single layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">data link</span></strong></li>
<li>network</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>physical</strong></span></li>
<li>session</li>
<li>transport</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The OSI data link and physical layers together are equivalent to the TCP/IP network access layer. The OSI transport layer is functionally equivalent to the TCP/IP transport layer, and the OSI network layer is equivalent to the TCP/IP internet layer. The OSI application, presentation, and session layers are functionally equivalent to the application layer within the TCP/IP model.</p></div>
<p><strong>47. At which layer of the OSI model would a logical address be added during encapsulation?</strong></p>

<li>physical layer</li>
<li>data link layer</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">network layer</span></strong></li>
<li>transport layer</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Logical addresses, also known as IP addresses, are added at the network layer. Physical addresses are edded at the data link layer. Port addresses are added at the transport layer. No addresses are added at the physical layer.</p></div>
<p><strong>48. What is a characteristic of multicast messages?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They are sent to a select group of hosts.</span></strong></li>
<li>They are sent to all hosts on a network.</li>
<li>They must be acknowledged.</li>
<li>They are sent to a single destination.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Multicast is a one-to-many type of communication. Multicast messages are addressed to a specific multicast group.</p></div>
<p><strong>49. Which statement is correct about network protocols?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Network protocols define the type of hardware that is used and how it is mounted in racks.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They define how messages are exchanged between the source and the destination.</span></strong></li>
<li>They all function in the network access layer of TCP/IP.</li>
<li>They are only required for exchange of messages between devices on remote networks.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Network protocols are implemented in hardware, or software, or both. They interact with each other within different layers of a protocol stack. Protocols have nothing to do with the installation of the network equipment. Network protocols are required to exchange information between source and destination devices in both local and remote networks.</p></div>
<p><strong>50. What is an advantage of network devices using open standard protocols?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Network communications is confined to data transfers between devices from the same vendor.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A client host and a server running different operating systems can successfully exchange data.</span></strong></li>
<li>Internet access can be controlled by a single ISP in each market.</li>
<li>Competition and innovation are limited to specific types of products.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An advantage of network devices implementing open standard protocols, such as from the TCP/IP suite, is that clients and servers running different operating systems can communicate with each other. Open standard protocols facilitate innovation and competition between vendors and across markets, and can reduce the occurrence of monopolies in networking markets.</p></div>
<p><strong>51. Which device performs the function of determining the path that messages should take through internetworks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a router</span></strong></li>
<li>a firewall</li>
<li>a web server</li>
<li>a DSL modem</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A router is used to determine the path that the messages should take through the network. A firewall is used to filter incoming and outgoing traffic. A DSL modem is used to provide Internet connection for a home or an organization.</p></div>

<p><strong>What is the IP address of the switch virtual interface (SVI) on Switch0?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">192.168.5.10</span></strong></li>
<li>192.168.10.5</li>
<li>192.168.10.1</li>
<li>192.168.5.0</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> After the enable command is issued, the show running-configuration command or the show ip interfaces brief command will display the IP address of the switch virtual interface (SVI).</p></div>
<p><strong>53. Why would a Layer 2 switch need an IP address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to enable the switch to send broadcast frames to attached PCs</li>
<li>to enable the switch to function as a default gateway</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to enable the switch to be managed remotely</span></strong></li>
<li>to enable the switch to receive frames from attached PCs</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A switch, as a Layer 2 device, does not need an IP address to transmit frames to attached devices. However, when a switch is accessed remotely through the network, it must have a Layer 3 address. The IP address must be applied to a virtual interface rather than to a physical interface. Routers, not switches, function as default gateways.</p></div>
<p><strong>54. Refer to the exhibit. An administrator is trying to configure the switch but receives the error message that is displayed in the exhibit. What is the problem?</strong></p>
<div style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i208399v1n1_Question201.png" alt="CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam Answers 50" width="308" height="55" /><p class="wp-caption-text">CCNA-1-v7-Modules-1-3-Basic Network Connectivity and Communications Exam Answers 54</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The entire command, configure terminal, must be used.</li>
<li>The administrator is already in global configuration mode.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The administrator must first enter privileged EXEC mode before issuing the command.</span></strong></li>
<li>The administrator must connect via the console port to access global configuration mode.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In order to enter global configuration mode, the command configure terminal, or a shortened version such as config t, must be entered from privileged EXEC mode. In this scenario the administrator is in user EXEC mode, as indicated by the &gt; symbol after the hostname. The administrator would need to use the enable command to move into privileged EXEC mode before entering the configure terminal command.</p></div>
