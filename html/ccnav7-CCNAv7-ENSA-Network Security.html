<li>nonrepudiation</li>
<li>authentication</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">integrity</span></strong></li>
<li>confidentiality</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Integrity is ensured by implementing either MD5 or SHA hash generating algorithms. Many modern networks ensure authentication with protocols, such as HMAC. Data confidentiality is ensured through symmetric encryption algorithms, including DES, 3DES, and AES. Data confidentiality can also be ensured using asymmetric algorithms, including RSA and PKI.​</p></div>
<p><strong>10. If an asymmetric algorithm uses a public key to encrypt data, what is used to decrypt it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a digital certificate</li>
<li>a different public key</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a private key</span></strong></li>
<li>DH</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When an asymmetric algorithm is used, public and private keys are used for the encryption. Either key can be used for encryption, but the complementary matched key must be used for the decryption. For example if the public key is used for encryption, then the private key must be used for the decryption.</p></div>
<p><strong>11. Refer to the exhibit. Which two ACLs would permit only the two LAN networks attached to R1 to access the network that connects to R2 G0/1 interface? (Choose two.)</strong></p>

<li>access-list 4 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The <strong>permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.127</strong> command ignores bit positions 1 through 7, which means that addresses 192.168.10.0 through 192.168.10.127 are allowed through. The two ACEs of <strong>permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.63</strong> and <strong>permit 192.168.10.64 0.0.0.63</strong> allow the same address range through the router.</p></div>
<p><strong>12. Which two packet filters could a network administrator use on an IPv4 extended ACL? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">destination UDP port number</span></strong></li>
<li>computer type</li>
<li>destination MAC address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ICMP message type</strong></span></li>
<li>source TCP hello address</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Extended access lists commonly filter on source and destination IPv4 addresses and TCP or UDP port numbers. Additional filtering can be provided for protocol types.</p></div>
<p><strong>13. What type of ACL offers greater flexibility and control over network access?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>numbered standard</li>
<li>named standard</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">extended</span></strong></li>
<li>flexible</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The two types of ACLs are standard and extended. Both types can be named or numbered, but extended ACLs offer greater flexibility.</p></div>
<p><strong>14. What is the quickest way to remove a single ACE from a named ACL?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Use the no keyword and the sequence number of the ACE to be removed.</span></strong></li>
<li>Copy the ACL into a text editor, remove the ACE, then copy the ACL back into the router.</li>
<li>Create a new ACL with a different number and apply the new ACL to the router interface.</li>
<li>Use the no access-list command to remove the entire ACL, then recreate it without the ACE.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Named ACL ACEs can be removed using the <strong>no</strong> command followed by the sequence number.</p></div>
<p><strong>15. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring a standard IPv4 ACL. What is the effect after the command no access-list 10 is entered?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37924 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i209863v1n1_209863.png" alt="" width="527" height="244" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i209863v1n1_209863.png 527w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i209863v1n1_209863-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>ACL 10 is removed from both the running configuration and the interface Fa0/1.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ACL 10 is removed from the running configuration.</span></strong></li>
<li>ACL 10 is disabled on Fa0/1.</li>
<li>ACL 10 will be disabled and removed after R1 restarts.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The R1(config)# <strong>no access-list</strong> <em>&lt;access-list number&gt;</em> command removes the ACL from the running-config immediately. However, to disable an ACL on an interface, the command R1(config-if)# <strong>no ip access-group</strong> should be entered.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator has configured ACL 9 as shown. Users on the 172.31.1.0 /24 network cannot forward traffic through router CiscoVille. What is the most likely cause of the traffic failure?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37925 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215685v4n1_ACL-item.png" alt="" width="570" height="194" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215685v4n1_ACL-item.png 570w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215685v4n1_ACL-item-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The established keyword is not specified.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The sequence of the ACEs is incorrect.</span></strong></li>
<li>The port number for the traffic has not been identified with the eq keyword.</li>
<li>The permit statement specifies an incorrect wildcard mask.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When verifying an ACL, the statements are always listed in a sequential order. Even though there is an explicit permit for the traffic that is sourced from network 172.31.1.0 /24, it is being denied due to the previously implemented ACE of <strong>CiscoVille(config)# access-list 9 deny 172.31.0.0 0.0.255.255</strong>. The sequence of the ACEs must be modified to permit the specific traffic that is sourced from network 172.31.1.0 /24 and then to deny 172.31.0.0 /16.</p></div>
<p><strong>17. A network administrator needs to configure a standard ACL so that only the workstation of the administrator with the IP address 192.168.15.23 can access the virtual terminal of the main router. Which two configuration commands can achieve the task? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.15.23 0.0.0.0</span></strong></li>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit host 192.168.15.23</strong></span></li>
<li>Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.15.23 255.255.255.0</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To permit or deny one specific IP address, either the wildcard mask <strong>0.0.0.0</strong> (used after the IP address) or the wildcard mask keyword <strong>host</strong> (used before the IP address) can be used.</p></div>
<p><strong>18. Refer to the exhibit. Which command would be used in a standard ACL to allow only devices on the network attached to R2 G0/0 interface to access the networks attached to R1?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37926" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i282156v1n2_282156.png" alt="" width="496" height="273" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i282156v1n2_282156.png 496w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i282156v1n2_282156-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></p>
<ul>

<li>access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.63</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Standard access lists only filter on the source IP address. In the design, the packets would be coming from the 192.168.10.96/27 network (the R2 G0/0 network). The correct ACL is <strong>access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.96 0.0.0.31</strong>.</p></div>
<p><strong>19. A network administrator is writing a standard ACL that will deny any traffic from the 172.16.0.0/16 network, but permit all other traffic. Which two commands should be used? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Router(config)# access-list 95 deny 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Router(config)# access-list 95 permit any</span></strong></li>

<li>Router(config)# access-list 95 deny any</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To deny traffic from the 172.16.0.0/16 network, the <strong>access-list 95 deny 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255</strong> command is used. To permit all other traffic, the <strong>access-list 95 permit any</strong> statement is added.</p></div>
<p><strong>20. Refer to the exhibit. An ACL was configured on R1 with the intention of denying traffic from subnet 172.16.4.0/24 into subnet 172.16.3.0/24. All other traffic into subnet 172.16.3.0/24 should be permitted. This standard ACL was then applied outbound on interface Fa0/0. Which conclusion can be drawn from this configuration?​</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The ACL should be applied outbound on all interfaces of R1.</li>
<li>The ACL should be applied to the FastEthernet 0/0 interface of R1 inbound to accomplish the requirements.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">All traffic will be blocked, not just traffic from the 172.16.4.0/24 subnet.</span></strong></li>
<li>Only traffic from the 172.16.4.0/24 subnet is blocked, and all other traffic is allowed.​</li>
<li>An extended ACL must be used in this situation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Because of the implicit deny at the end of all ACLs, the <strong>access-list 1 permit any</strong> command must be included to ensure that only traffic from the 172.16.4.0/24 subnet is blocked and that all other traffic is allowed.​</p></div>
<p><strong>21. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator needs to add an ACE to the TRAFFIC-CONTROL ACL that will deny IP traffic from the subnet 172.23.16.0/20. Which ACE will meet this requirement?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37928 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i282896v1n2_282896.gif" alt="" width="471" height="114" /></p>

<li>5 deny 172.23.16.0 0.0.255.255</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The only filtering criteria specified for a standard access list is the source IPv4 address. The wild card mask is written to identify what parts of the address to match, with a 0 bit, and what parts of the address should be ignored, which a 1 bit. The router will parse the ACE entries from lowest sequence number to highest. If an ACE must be added to an existing access list, the sequence number should be specified so that the ACE is in the correct place during the ACL evaluation process.</p></div>
<p><strong>22. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator configures an ACL on the router. Which statement describes the result of the configuration?</strong></p>

No matches have occurred on this ACE as evidenced by the lack of a &#8220;(xxx matches)&#8221; ACE. The deny ip any any ACE is not required because there is an implicit deny ACE added to every access control list. When no matches exist for an ACL, it only means that no traffic has matched the conditions that exist for that particular line. The ACL is monitoring traffic that matches three specific hosts going to very specific destination devices. All other traffic is not permitted by the implicit deny ip any any ACE.</p></div>

</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An extended ACL is placed as close to the source of the traffic as possible. In this case.it is placed in an inbound direction on interface fa0/0 on R2 for traffic entering the router from host with the IP address192.168.1.1 bound for the server with the IP address192.168.2.1.</p></div>
<p><strong>25. Consider the following access list.</strong></p>
<p><em>access-list 100 permit ip host 192.168.10.1 any</em><br />
<em>access-list 100 deny icmp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any echo</em><br />
<em>access-list 100 permit ip any any</em></p>
<p><strong>Which two actions are taken if the access list is placed inbound on a router Gigabit Ethernet port that has the IP address 192.168.10.254 assigned? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only Layer 3 connections are allowed to be made from the router to any other network device.</li>
<li>Devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network are not allowed to reply to any ping requests.</li>
<li>Devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network can sucessfully ping devices on the 192.168.11.0 network.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A Telnet or SSH session is allowed from any device on the 192.168.10.0 into the router with this access list assigned.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network are allowed to reply to any ping requests.</strong></span></li>
<li>Only the network device assigned the IP address 192.168.10.1 is allowed to access the router.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The first ACE allows the 192.168.10.1 device to do any TCP/IP-based transactions with any other destination. The second ACE stops devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network from issuing any pings to any other location. Everything else is permitted by the third ACE. Therefore, a Telnet/SSH session or ping reply is allowed from a device on the 192.168.10.0/24 network.</p></div>
<p><strong>26. Refer to the exhibit. The named ACL &#8220;Managers&#8221; already exists on the router. What will happen when the network administrator issues the commands that are shown in the exhibit?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37932 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i148460n1v1.jpg" alt="" width="409" height="78" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i148460n1v1.jpg 409w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i148460n1v1-300x57.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The commands are added at the end of the existing Managers ACL.</span></strong></li>
<li>The commands overwrite the existing Managers ACL.</li>
<li>The commands are added at the beginning of the existing Managers ACL.</li>
<li>The network administrator receives an error that states that the ACL already exists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>27. In which TCP attack is the cybercriminal attempting to overwhelm a target host with half-open TCP connections?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>port scan attack</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SYN flood attack</span></strong></li>
<li>session hijacking attack</li>
<li>reset attack</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a TCP SYN flood attack, the attacker sends to the target host a continuous flood of TCP SYN session requests with a spoofed source IP address. The target host responds with a TCP-SYN-ACK to each of the SYN session requests and waits for a TCP ACK that will never arrive. Eventually the target is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections.</p></div>
<p><strong>28. Which protocol is attacked when a cybercriminal provides an invalid gateway in order to create a man-in-the-middle attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">DHCP</span></strong></li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>ICMP</li>
<li>HTTP or HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A cybercriminal could set up a rogue DHCP server that provides one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong default gateway that is used to create a man-in-the-middle attack and allow the attacker to intercept data</li>
<li>Wrong DNS server that results in the user being sent to a malicious website</li>
<li>Invalid default gateway IP address that results in a denial of service attack on the DHCP client</p></div></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>29. Refer to the exhibit. An administrator has configured a standard ACL on R1 and applied it to interface serial 0/0/0 in the outbound direction. What happens to traffic leaving interface serial 0/0/0 that does not match the configured ACL statements?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37933" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i233528v1n1_233527.png" alt="" width="386" height="151" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i233528v1n1_233527.png 386w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i233528v1n1_233527-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The traffic is dropped.</span></strong></li>
<li>The source IP address is checked and, if a match is not found, traffic is routed out interface serial 0/0/1.</li>
<li>The resulting action is determined by the destination IP address.</li>
<li>The resulting action is determined by the destination IP address and port number.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Any traffic that does not match one of the statements in an ACL has the implicit deny applied to it, which means the traffic is dropped.</p></div>
<p><strong>30. Refer to the exhibit. The Gigabit interfaces on both routers have been configured with subinterface numbers that match the VLAN numbers connected to them. PCs on VLAN 10 should be able to print to the P1 printer on VLAN 12. PCs on VLAN 20 should print to the printers on VLAN 22. What interface and in what direction should you place a standard ACL that allows printing to P1 from data VLAN 10, but stops the PCs on VLAN 20 from using the P1 printer? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37934" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215806v1n2_215806.png" alt="" width="673" height="321" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215806v1n2_215806.png 673w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215806v1n2_215806-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></p>

<li>R1 S0/0/0</li>
<li>R2 Gi0/1.20</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A standard access list is commonly placed as close to the destination network as possible because access control expressions in a standard ACL do not include information about the destination network.<br />
The destination in this example is printer VLAN 12 which has router R1 Gigabit subinterface 0/1/.12 as its gateway. A sample standard ACL that only allows printing from data VLAN 10 (192.168.10.0/24), for example, and no other VLAN would be as follows:</p>
<pre>R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255

R1(config)# access-list 1 deny any

R1(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/1.12

R1(config-if)# ip access-group 1 out</pre>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>31. Which statement describes a characteristic of standard IPv4 ACLs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are configured in the interface configuration mode.</li>
<li>They can be configured to filter traffic based on both source IP addresses and source ports.</li>
<li>They can be created with a number but not with a name.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They filter traffic based on source IP addresses only.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A standard IPv4 ACL can filter traffic based on source IP addresses only. Unlike an extended ACL, it cannot filter traffic based on Layer 4 ports. However, both standard and extended ACLs can be identified with either a number or a name, and both are configured in global configuration mode.</p></div>
<p><strong>32. What is considered a best practice when configuring ACLs on vty lines?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Place identical restrictions on all vty lines.</span></strong></li>
<li>Remove the vty password since the ACL restricts access to trusted users.</li>
<li>Apply the ip access-group command inbound.</li>
<li>Use only extended access lists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>33. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37935 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i241882v4n1_241882.png" alt="" width="248" height="104" /><br />
Refer to the exhibit. An administrator first configured an extended ACL as shown by the output of the show access-lists command. The administrator then edited this access-list by issuing the commands below.</strong></p>
<pre>Router(config)# ip access-list extended 101 

Router(config-ext-nacl)# no 20

Router(config-ext-nacl)# 5 permit tcp any any eq 22

Router(config-ext-nacl)# 20 deny udp any any</pre>
<p><strong>Which two conclusions can be drawn from this new configuration?​ (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TFTP packets will be permitted.​</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Ping packets will be permitted.</strong></span></li>
<li>Telnet packets will be permitted.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SSH packets will be permitted.</strong></span></li>
<li>All TCP and UDP packets will be denied.​</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> After the editing, the final configuration is as follows:<br />
Router#<strong> show access-lists</strong><br />
Extended IP access list 101<br />
5 permit tcp any any eq ssh<br />
10 deny tcp any any<br />
20 deny udp any any<br />
30 permit icmp any any<br />
So, only SSH packets and ICMP packets will be permitted.​</p></div>
<p><strong>34. Which set of access control entries would allow all users on the 192.168.10.0/24 network to access a web server that is located at 172.17.80.1, but would not allow them to use Telnet?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For an extended ACL to meet these requirements the following need to be included in the access control entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>identification number in the range 100-199 or 2000-2699</li>
<li>permit or deny parameter</li>
<li>protocol</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>36. Refer to the exhibit. The network administrator has an IP address of 192.168.11.10 and needs access to manage R1. What is the best ACL type and placement to use in this situation?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37936" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i350680v1n1_C3M4-Diagram.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="442" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i350680v1n1_C3M4-Diagram.jpg 570w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i350680v1n1_C3M4-Diagram-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>extended ACL outbound on R2 WAN interface towards the internet</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">standard ACL inbound on R1 vty lines</span></strong></li>
<li>extended ACLs inbound on R1 G0/0 and G0/1</li>
<li>extended ACL outbound on R2 S0/0/1</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Standard ACLs permit or deny packets based only on the source IPv4 address. Because all traffic types are permitted or denied, standard ACLs should be located as close to the destination as possible.</p>
<p>Extended ACLs permit or deny packets based on the source IPv4 address and destination IPv4 address, protocol type, source and destination TCP or UDP ports and more. Because the filtering of extended ACLs is so specific, extended ACLs should be located as close as possible to the source of the traffic to be filtered. Undesirable traffic is denied close to the source network without crossing the network infrastructure.</p></div>
<p><strong>37. A technician is tasked with using ACLs to secure a router. When would the technician use the any configuration option or command?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to add a text entry for documentation purposes</li>
<li>to generate and send an informational message whenever the ACE is matched</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to identify any IP address</strong></span></li>
<li>to identify one specific IP address</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>38. Which statement accurately characterizes the evolution of threats to network security?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Internet architects planned for network security from the beginning.</li>
<li>Early Internet users often engaged in activities that would harm other users.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Internal threats can cause even greater damage than external threats.</span></strong></li>
<li>Threats have become less sophisticated while the technical knowledge needed by an attacker has grown.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Internal threats can be intentional or accidental and cause greater damage than external threats because the internal user has direct access to the internal corporate network and corporate data.</p></div>
<p><strong>39. A user receives a phone call from a person who claims to represent IT services and then asks that user for confirmation of username and password for auditing purposes. Which security threat does this phone call represent?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>spam</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">social engineering</span></strong></li>
<li>DDoS</li>
<li>anonymous keylogging</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Social engineering attempts to gain the confidence of an employee and convince that person to divulge confidential and sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords. DDoS attacks, spam, and keylogging are all examples of software based security threats, not social engineering.</p></div>
<p><strong>40. In what way are zombies used in security attacks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They target specific individuals to gain corporate or personal information.</li>
<li>They probe a group of machines for open ports to learn which services are running.</li>
<li>They are maliciously formed code segments used to replace legitimate applications.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They are infected machines that carry out a DDoS attack.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Zombies are infected computers that make up a botnet. The zombies are used to deploy a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</p></div>
<p><strong>41. Which attack involves threat actors positioning themselves between a source and destination with the intent of transparently monitoring, capturing, and controlling the communication?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">man-in-the-middle attack</span></strong></li>
<li>SYN flood attack</li>
<li>DoS attack</li>
<li>ICMP attack</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>The man-in-the-middle attack is a common IP-related attack where threat actors position themselves between a source and destination to transparently monitor, capture, and control the communication.</p></div>
<p><strong>42. Which two keywords can be used in an access control list to replace a wildcard mask or address and wildcard mask pair? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">host</span></strong></li>
<li>most</li>
<li>gt</li>
<li>some</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">any</span></strong></li>
<li>all</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>The <b>host </b>keyword is used when using a specific device IP address in an ACL. For example, the <b>deny host 192.168.5.5 </b>command is the same is the <b>deny 192.168.5.5 0.0.0.0 </b>command. The <b>any </b>keyword is used to allow any mask through that meets the criteria. For example, the <b>permit any </b>command is the same as <b>permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 </b>command.</p></div>
<p><strong>43. Which statement describes a difference between the operation of inbound and outbound ACLs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Inbound ACLs are processed before the packets are routed while outbound ACLs are processed after the routing is completed.</span></strong></li>
<li>In contrast to outbound ALCs, inbound ACLs can be used to filter packets with multiple criteria.</li>
<li>On a network interface, more than one inbound ACL can be configured but only one outbound ACL can be configured.</li>
<li>Inbound ACLs can be used in both routers and switches but outbound ACLs can be used only on routers.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>With an inbound ACL, incoming packets are processed before they are routed. With an outbound ACL, packets are first routed to the outbound interface, then they are processed. Thus processing inbound is more efficient from the router perspective. The structure, filtering methods, and limitations (on an interface, only one inbound and one outbound ACL can be configured) are the same for both types of ACLs.</p></div>
<p><strong>44. What effect would the Router1(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 172.16.4.0 0.0.0.255 any eq www command have when implemented inbound on the f0/0 interface?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All TCP traffic is permitted, and all other traffic is denied.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Traffic originating from 172.16.4.0/24 is permitted to all TCP port 80 destinations.</span></strong></li>
<li>All traffic from 172.16.4.0/24 is permitted anywhere on any port.</li>
<li>The command is rejected by the router because it is incomplete.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>45. Which ACE will permit a packet that originates from any network and is destined for a web server at 192.168.1.1?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">access-list 101 permit tcp any host 192.168.1.1 eq 80</span></strong></li>
<li>access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 eq 80 any</li>
<li>access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 any eq 80</li>
<li>access-list 101 permit tcp any eq 80 host 192.168.1.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>46. Refer to the exhibit. A new network policy requires an ACL denying FTP and Telnet access to a Corp file server from all interns.

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>This access list must be an extended ACL in order to filter on specific source and destination host addresses. Commonly, the best place for an extended ACL is closest to the source, which is H1. Traffic from H1 travels into the switch, then out of the switch into the R1 Gi0/0 interface. This Gi0/0 interface would be the best location for this type of extended ACL. The ACL would be applied on the inbound interface since the packets from H1 would be coming into the R1 router.</p></div>
