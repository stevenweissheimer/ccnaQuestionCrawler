<p><strong>1. An instructor is reviewing student answers on a previous term exam to prepare for a lecture on IPv6. What would be a good point for the instructor to make when explaining an IPv6 GUA (global unicast address)?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is considered a best practice to use the IPV6 GUA address of the router as the default gateway address for Windows hosts.</li>
<li>It can be configured statically or assigned dynamically on a router.</li>
<li>It can only be configured statically on a host interface by using the ipv6 address command.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is routable on the IPv6 internet.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. An administrator needs to implement a 2.4GHz WLAN that requires multiple APs. Which two are characteristics of the 2.4GHz channels? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They can provide faster data transmission for wireless clients in heavily populated wireless networks than 5GHz channels.</li>
<li>Each channel is separated from the next channel by 20 MHz.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">There are 11 channels for North America identified by the 802.11b standard.</span></strong></li>
<li>If three adjacent APs are required, the non-overlapping channels 1, 21, and 41 are recommended.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Each channel is allotted 22 MHz bandwidth.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. A technician must accommodate at least 500 subnets from address 172.16.0.0/16. What is an appropriate subnet mask and corresponding number of available host IP addresses per subnet to meet the requirement?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">255.255.255.128 and 126 hosts</span></strong></li>
<li>255.255.255.0 and 128 hosts</li>
<li>255.255.255.192 and 126 hosts</li>
<li>255.255.255.224 and 128 hosts</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The network address 172.16.0.0 has a default mask of 255.255.0.0 (/16). This address has 16 bits in the network portion and 16 bits in the host portion. To have at least 500 subnets, you need to borrow 9 bits (subnets) from the host portion (2^9 = 512 subnets), leaving 7 bits to create hosts. Thus the resulting netmask is 255.255.255.128, and the number of hosts per subnet is 2^7 = 128 &#8211; 2 = 126 hosts.</p></div>
<p><strong>4. Refer to the exhibit. A PC with the MAC address of 0800.069d.3841 attached to port Fa0/8 is sending data to a device that has the MAC address of 6400.6a5a.6821. What will the switch do first to handle the data transfer?</strong></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55867" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/i349899v1n1_switchop.png" alt="" width="432" height="229" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/i349899v1n1_switchop.png 432w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/i349899v1n1_switchop-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The switch will add the address 0800.069d.3841 to the MAC address table.</span></strong></li>
<li>The switch will send the frame to ports Fa0/4 and Fa0/6.</li>
<li>The switch will flood the frame out all ports except port Fa0/8.</li>
<li>The switch will send the frame to port Fa0/6.</li>
<li>The switch will add the address 6400.6151.6821 to the MAC address table.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Every frame that enters a switch is checked for new information to learn. It does this by examining the source MAC address of the frame and port number where the frame entered the switch:</p>
<p>If the source MAC address does not exist in the MAC address table, the MAC address and incoming port number are added to the table.</p></div>
<p><strong>5. A network engineer is giving a tour of the company network operations center to a college class. The engineer is trying to describe how a WAN and connectivity to the internet relate to the network infrastructure. Which statement correctly describes network infrastructure and network communication?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Communication across the internet requires application of recognized technologies and standards.</span></strong></li>
<li>LANs are used to connect WANs around the world.</li>
<li>A LAN connects small networks to large global networks.</li>
<li>The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks owned by an organization.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>The internet is not owned by any individual or group. Ensuring effective communication across this diverse infrastructure requires the application of consistent and commonly recognized technologies and standards as well as the cooperation of many network administration agencies.</p></div>
<p><strong>6. A network engineer is designing a borderless switched network in a hierarchical fashion. Which guideline might cause the engineer to implement a three-tier layer model?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fault isolation is one of the primary purposes of the distribution layer.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Access layer L2 switches connect to distribution layer L3 switches, which implement routing, quality of service, and security.</strong></span></li>
<li>The core layer provides differentiated services to various classes of service applications at the edge of the network.</li>
<li>The access layer provides aggregation of Layer 2 broadcast domains.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>The access layer represents the network edge, where traffic enters or exits the campus network. Traditionally, the primary function of an access layer switch is to provide network access to the user. Access layer switches connect to distribution layer switches, which implement network foundation technologies such as routing, quality of service, and security.</p></div>
<p><strong>7. Two students are discussing routers and one statement that is said between them is accurate. Which statement is that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A directly-connected network is automatically added to the routing table of an adjacency neighbor if both routers are Cisco routers.</li>
<li>A gateway of last resort is added to the routing table when the router boots up.</li>
<li>Remote networks can only be added after they are learned by routers through dynamic routing protocols.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A default route provides a way for packets that do not match a specific route in the routing table to be forwarded.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. What are two benefits of using virtualization? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The operating system of the virtual machine does not require licensing when it is virtualized.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The virtual machine is no longer dependent on a specific hardware platform.</span></strong></li>
<li>Because all virtual operating systems are contained within a single virtual network, networking connections are simplified.</li>
<li>The performance of a virtual machine is faster than the performance of the operating system running on physical hardware.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Multiple virtual machines can be running simultaneously on a single physical device.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Students in a data networking class are reviewing materials in preparation for a quiz. Which statement describes the operation of an access control method for shared network media?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The controlled-based access method, used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet LANs, decided the order of each device to transmit.</li>
<li>In the CSMA/CD method, when two devices transmit at the same time, a collision is detected and data is resent immediately.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The CSMA/CA method attempts to avoid collisions by having each device informing others how long the media will be unavailable.</span></strong></li>
<li>In a contention-based multiaccess network, each node has its own time to use the medium.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>CMSA/CA does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before transmitting. Each device that transmits includes the time duration that it needs for the transmission. All other wireless devices receive this information and know how long the medium will be unavailable.</p></div>
<p><strong>10. A network administrator is designing an IPv4 addressing scheme and requires these subnets.</strong></p>

<p>IPv4 subnets that require 100 and 80 hosts are provided by creating subnets of 126 usable addresses, each of which requires 7 host bits. The resulting mask is 255.255.255.128.</p>
<p>Subnets that require 30 and 20 hosts are provided by creating subnets of 30 usable addresses, each of which requires 5 host bits. The resulting mask is 255.255.255.224.</p>
<p>Creating nine subnets, each consisting of 126 usable addresses, would waste large numbers of addresses in the six smaller subnets.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Packets with a destination of 172.17.6.15 are forwarded through Fa0/0. Packets with a destination of 172.17.10.5 are forwarded through Fa1/1. Packets with a destination of 172.17.12.10 are forwarded through Fa1/0. Packets with a destination of 172.17.14.8 are forwarded through Fa0/1. Because network 172.17.8.0 has no entry in the routing table, it will take the gateway of last resort, which means that packets with a destination of 172.17.8.20 are forwarded through Serial0/0/0. Because a gateway of last resort exists, no packets will be dropped.</p></div>
<p><strong>37. Consider the following static route configured on a Cisco router:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>38. A network administrator configures a router with the <code>ipv6 route ::/0 Serial2/0</code> command. What is the purpose of this command?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to add a dynamic route for the destination network ::/0 to the routing table</li>
<li>to enable a router to forward packets for which there is no route in the routing table</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to forward packets destined for the network ::/0 to the serial 2/0 interface</span></strong></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>41. What defines a host route on a Cisco router?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">An IPv4 static host route configuration uses a destination IP address of a specific device and a /32 subnet mask.</span></strong></li>
<li>A static IPv6 host route must include the interface type and the interface number of the next hop router.</li>
<li>A host route is designated with a C in the routing table.</li>

<strong>Which task has to be performed on Router 1 for it to establish an OSPF adjacency with Router 2?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issue the clear ip ospf process command.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Change the subnet mask of interface FastEthernet 0/0 to 255.255.255.0.</span></strong></li>
<li>Remove the passive interface command from interface FastEthernet 0/0.</li>
<li>Add the network 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 command to the OSPF process.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Each interface on the link connecting the OSPF routers must be in the same subnet for an adjacency to be established. The IP address subnet mask on FastEthernet interface 0/0 must be changed to 255.255.255.0. The FastEthernet interface 0/0 is not passive. The 10.0.1.0/24 network is only connected to Router2 so should not be advertised by Router1. The<strong> clear ip ospf process</strong> command will start the OPSF process on Router1 but will not cause an adjacency to be established if the subnet mask mismatch on the connecting interfaces still exists.</p></div>
<p><strong>46. What is the recommended Cisco best practice for configuring an OSPF-enabled router so that each router can be easily identified when troubleshooting routing issues?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the highest IP address assigned to an active interface participating in the routing process.</li>
<li>Use a loopback interface configured with the highest IP address on the router.</li>
<li>Use the highest active interface IP address that is configured on the router.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Configure a value using the router-id command.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A Cisco router is assigned a router ID to uniquely identify it. It can be automatically assigned and take the value of the highest configured IP address on any interface, the value of a specifically-configured loopback address, or the value assigned (which is in the exact form of an IP address) using the <code>router-id</code> command. Cisco recommends using the <code>router-id</code> command.</p></div>
<p><strong>47. In FHRP terminology, what represents a set of routers that present the illusion of a single router to hosts?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>standby router</li>
<li>forwarding router</li>
<li>default gateway</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">virtual router</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In FHRP multiple routers are configured to work together to present to hosts a single gateway router. This single gateway router is a virtual router which has a virtual IP address that is used by hosts as a default gateway.</p></div>
<p><strong>48. A network administrator is configuring the SNMP function on a Cisco 3500 series WLC. The task is to add an SNMP trap server to which this WLC will forward SNMP log messages. Which tab should the administrator use to add the SNMP trap server information?</strong></p>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The details of each port state are shown in the table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Port State</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Blocking</td>
<td>The port is an alternate port and does not participate in frame forwarding. The port receives BPDU frames to determine the location and root ID of the root bridge. BPDU frames also determine which port roles each switch port should assume in the final active STP topology. With a Max Age timer of 20 seconds, a switch port that has not received an expected BPDU from a neighbor switch will go into the blocking state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Listening</td>
<td>After the blocking state, a port will move to the listening state. The port receives BPDUs to determine the path to the root. The switch port also transmits its own BPDU frames and informs adjacent switches that the switch port is preparing to participate in the active topology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Learning</td>
<td>A switch port transitions to the learning state after the listening state. During the learning state, the switch port receives and processes BPDUs and prepares to participate in frame forwarding. It also begins to populate the MAC address table. However, in the learning state, user frames are not forwarded to the destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Forwarding</td>
<td>In the forwarding state, a switch port is considered part of the active topology. The switch port forwards user traffic and sends and receives BPDU frames.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>A switch port in the disabled state does not participate in spanning tree and does not forward frames. The disabled state is set when the switch port is administratively disabled.</td>
</tr>

<li>Gig0/1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>52. What is the purpose of setting the native VLAN separate from data VLANs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The native VLAN is for routers and switches to exchange their management information, so it should be different from data VLANs.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A separate VLAN should be used to carry uncommon untagged frames to avoid bandwidth contention on data VLANs.</span></strong></li>
<li>The native VLAN is for carrying VLAN management traffic only.</li>
<li>The security of management frames that are carried in the native VLAN can be enhanced.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a Cisco switch trunk port receives untagged frames (unusual in well-designed networks), it forwards these frames to the native VLAN. When the native VLAN is moved away from data VLANs, those untagged frames will not compete for bandwidth in the data VLANs. The native VLAN is not designed for carrying management traffic, but rather it is for backward compatibility with legacy LAN scenarios.</p></div>
<p><strong>53. Which is a characteristic of EtherChannel?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>EtherChannel uses physical ports that have been upgraded to provide a faster connection.</strong></span></li>
<li>EtherChannel configuration is applied to each physical port.</li>
<li>STP treats all interfaces in an EtherChannel bundle as a single logical link.</li>
<li>STP will not block redundant EtherChannel bundles between two switches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>54. What characteristic describes how data or voice VLANs are configured on a network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Voice VLANs are configured on a trunk link between the IP phone and the switch.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A switch port that has been configured in access mode can only belong to one data VLAN at a time.</span></strong></li>
<li>The switchport access vlan command must specify a VLAN currently configured in the vlan.dat file</li>
<li>Data and voice VLANs have a different value range for VLAN IDs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>55. What are two load-balancing methods in the EtherChannel technology? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>combination of source port and IP to destination port and IP</li>

<li>combination of source MAC and IP to destination MAC and IP</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">source MAC to destination MAC</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Depending on the hardware platform, one or more load-balancing methods can be implemented. These methods include source MAC to destination MAC load balancing or source IP to destination IP load balancing, across the physical links.</p></div>
<p><strong>56. A network administrator is configuring a WLAN with WPA2 Enterprise on a Cisco 3500 series WLC. Client authentications will be handled by a RADIUS server. Which tab should the administrator use to add the RADIUS server information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>57. An administrator issues the <code>show vlan brief</code> command on a Cisco switch and the output shows that all ports are currently assigned to the default VLAN. What conclusion can be drawn?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Layer 2 control traffic is not associated with any VLAN.</li>
<li>The switch cannot be remotely managed using Telnet or SSH until a management VLAN has been created.</li>
<li>All user data traffic will be separated and secured from other users.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">There is a security risk because the management VLAN and the native VLAN are the same.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>58. If no bridge priority is configured in PVST, which criteria is considered when electing the root bridge?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>highest IP address</li>
<li>lowest IP address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>lowest MAC address</strong></span></li>
<li>highest MAC address</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Only one switch can be the root bridge for a VLAN. The root bridge is the switch with the lowest BID. The BID is determined by priority and the MAC address. If no priority is configured then all switches use the default priority and the election of the root bridge will be based on the lowest MAC address.</p></div>

</ul>
<p><strong>76. What characteristic completes the following statement?</strong><br />
When an IPv6 static route is configured, the use of a link-local address as a next-hop address requires entering &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the interface type and interface number.</strong></span></li>
<li>the &#8220;show ipv6 route static&#8221; command.</li>
<li>the next-hop address of two different adjacent routers.</li>
<li>the &#8220;ipv6 unicast-routing&#8221; command.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>77. A network engineer is examining the routing table of a Cisco router. Consider the following routing table entry: </strong></p>
<pre>S 10.2.2.0/30 [1/0] via 10.1.1.2, 00:00:13, Serial0/0/0</pre>
<p>What is the significance of the Serial0/0/0?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the interface on the next-hop router that is directly connected to the 10.2.2.0/30 network</li>
<li>It is the interface on the next-hop router that is directly connected to the 10.1.1.0/24 network.</li>
<li>It is the R4 interface through which the OSPF update was learned.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is the interface R4 uses to send data that is destined for 10.2.2.0/30.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>78. When creating an IPv6 static route, when must a next-hop IPv6 address and an exit interface both be specified?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>when the static route is a default route</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>when the next hop is a link-local address</strong></span></li>
<li>when the exit interface is a point-to-point interface</li>
<li>when CEF is enabled</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Link-local addresses are only unique on a given link, and the same address could exist out multiple interfaces. For that reason, any time a static route specifies a link-local address as the next hop, it must also specify the exit interface. This is called a fully specified static route.</p></div>
<p><strong>79. What characterizes a floating static route?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is a less trustworthy route than the primary route.</strong></span></li>
<li>It provides load balancing with another static route to the same destination.</li>
<li>It is configured with a lower administrative distance than the primary router</li>
<li>It serves as a backup to an OSPF-learned route as long as it is configured with an administrative distance of 105.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>80. Which feature on a Cisco router permits the forwarding of traffic for which there is no specific route?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>next-hop</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>gateway of last resort</strong></span></li>
<li>outgoing interface</li>
<li>route source</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A default static route is used as a gateway of last resort to forward unknown destination traffic to a next hop/exit interface. The next-hop or exit interface is the destination to send traffic to on a network after the traffic is matched in a router. The route source is the location a route was learned from.</p></div>
<p><strong>81. Which ACE would permit traffic from hosts only on the 192.168.8.0/22 subnet?</strong></p>

<p><strong>107. What is the purpose of the overload keyword in the ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT_POOL overload command?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It allows many inside hosts to share one or a few inside global addresses.</strong></span></li>
<li>It allows a list of internal hosts to communicate with a specific group of external hosts.</li>
<li>It allows external hosts to initiate sessions with internal hosts.</li>
<li>It allows a pool of inside global addresses to be used by internal hosts.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dynamic NAT uses a pool of inside global addresses that are assigned to outgoing sessions. If there are more internal hosts than public addresses in the pool, then an administrator can enable port address translation with the addition of the <strong>overload</strong> keyword. With port address translation, many internal hosts can share a single inside global address because the NAT device will track the individual sessions by Layer 4 port number.</p></div>

<li>Add a new 802.11b device.</li>
<li>Add a new 802.11a device.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 802.11n devices are interoperable with all the other standards, and provide more bandwidth than the other standards. 802.11a is not interoperable with any of the other standards. 802.11b and 802.11g interoperate with each other, but do not provide the bandwidth supplied by 802.11n devices.</p></div>
<p><strong>110. What action takes place when a frame entering a switch has a unicast destination MAC address appearing in the MAC address table?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The switch forwards the frame out of the specified port.</strong></span></li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame out all ports except the incoming port.</li>
<li>The switch purges the entire MAC address table.</li>
<li>The switch replaces the old entry and uses the more current port.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>111. A technician is reviewing a report of slowness during peak traffic periods and is looking at performance on a particular switch. What should the technician be aware of about memory buffering on a switch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The port-based memory method is more appropriate to asymmetric switching.</li>
<li>If shared memory is used, a single frame can delay the transmission of all others in memory because of a busy destination port.</li>
<li>The amount of buffer memory required by a port is dynamically allocated when port-based memory is used.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shared memory allows traffic received on one port to be transmitted to another port without moving the data to a different queue.</strong></span></li>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They are configured as trunk interfaces.</strong></span></li>
<li>They are administratively shut down.</li>
<li>There is no media connected to the interfaces.</li>
<li>There is a native VLAN mismatch between the switches.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Interfaces that are configured as trunks do not belong to a VLAN and therefore will not show in the output of the <strong>show vlan brief</strong> commands.</p></div>
<p><strong>120. Data is being sent from a source PC to a destination server. Which three statements correctly describe the function of TCP or UDP in this situation? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The source port field identifies the running application or service that will handle data returning to the PC.</span></li>
<li>The TCP process running on the PC randomly selects the destination port when establishing a session with the server.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">UDP segments are encapsulated within IP packets for transport across the network.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The UDP destination port number identifies the application or service on the server which will handle the data.</span></li>
<li>TCP is the preferred protocol when a function requires lower network overhead.</li>
<li>The TCP source port number identifies the sending host on the network.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Layer 4 port numbers identify the application or service which will handle the data. The source port number is added by the sending device and will be the destination port number when the requested information is returned. Layer 4 segments are encapsulated within IP packets. UDP, not TCP, is used when low overhead is needed. A source IP address, not a TCP source port number, identifies the sending host on the network. Destination port numbers are specific ports that a server application or service monitors for requests.</p></div>
<p><strong>121. Which two 802.11 WLAN standards operate in both the 2.4 GHz and in the 5 GHz frequency bands? (Choose two.)</strong></p>

<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RADIUS</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Server-based AAA authentication uses an external TACACS or RADIUS authentication server to maintain a username and password database. When a client establishes a connection with an AAA enabled device, the device authenticates the client by querying the authentication servers.</p></div>

</ul>
<p><strong>128. What action takes place when the source MAC address of a frame entering a switch appears in the MAC address table associated with a different port?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The switch resets the refresh timer on all MAC address table entries.</li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame out all ports except the incoming port.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The switch replaces the old entry and uses the more current port.</span></li>
<li>The switch updates the refresh timer for the entry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>129. Refer to the exhibit. Static NAT is being configured to allow PC 1 access to the web server on the internal network. What two addresses are needed in place of A and B to complete the static NAT configuration? (Choose two.)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37948" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i282898v1n2_282898.gif" alt="" width="589" height="404" /></p>
<ul>
<li>A = 209.165.201.2</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">A = 10.1.0.13</span></li>
<li>B = 209.165.201.7</li>
<li>B = 10.0.254.5</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">B = 209.165.201.1</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Static NAT is a one-to-one mapping between an inside local address and an inside global address. By using static NAT, external devices can initiate connections to internal devices by using the inside global addresses. The NAT devices will translate the inside global address to the inside local address of the target host.</p></div>

<p><strong>135. What defines a two-tier spine-leaf topology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is two hops from everything else.</li>
<li>The spine tier can be implemented with Cisco Nexus 9500 switches connected to each other and to the leaf switches.</li>
<li>The APIC controller manipulates the data path directly.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Cisco APICs and all other devices in the network physically attach to leaf switches.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In this two-tier topology, everything is one hop from everything else. The leaf switches (Cisco Nexus 9300) always attach to the spines (Cisco Nexus 9500), but never to each other. Similarly, the spine switches only attach to the leaf and core switches. The Cisco APICs and all other devices in the network physically attach to leaf switches. When compared to SDN, the APIC controller does not manipulate the data path directly.</p></div><br />
