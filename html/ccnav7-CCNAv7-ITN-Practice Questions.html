<p><strong>4. Refer to the exhibit. An administrator is trying to configure the switch but receives the error message that is displayed in the exhibit. What is the problem?</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/i208399v1n1_Question201.png" alt="" width="308" height="55" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45378" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/i208399v1n1_Question201.png 308w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/i208399v1n1_Question201-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The entire command, configure terminal, must be used.</li>
<li>The administrator is already in global configuration mode.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The administrator must first enter privileged EXEC mode before issuing the command.</span></strong></li>
<li>The administrator must connect via the console port to access global configuration mode.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In order to enter global configuration mode, the command configure terminal, or a shortened version such as config t, must be entered from privileged EXEC mode. In this scenario the administrator is in user EXEC mode, as indicated by the &gt; symbol after the hostname. The administrator would need to use the enable command to move into privileged EXEC mode before entering the configure terminal command.</p></div>
<p><strong>5. What is a user trying to determine when issuing a ping 10.1.1.1 command on a PC?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if the TCP/IP stack is functioning on the PC without putting traffic on the wire</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>if there is connectivity with the destination device</strong></span></li>
<li>the path that traffic will take to reach the destination</li>
<li>what type of device is at the destination</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>The ping destination command can be used to test connectivity.</p></div>
<p><strong>6. What is a characteristic of a switch virtual interface (SVI)?​</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">An SVI is created in software and requires a configured IP address and a subnet mask in order to provide remote access to the switch.</span></strong></li>
<li>Although it is a virtual interface, it needs to have physical hardware on the device associated with it.</li>
<li>SVIs do not require the no shutdown command to become enabled.</li>
<li>SVIs come preconfigured on Cisco switches.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> Cisco IOS Layer 2 switches have physical ports for devices to connect. These ports do not support Layer 3 IP addresses. Therefore, switches have one or more switch virtual interfaces (SVIs). These are virtual interfaces because there is no physical hardware on the device associated with it. An SVI is created in software.</p>
<p>The virtual interface lets you remotely manage a switch over a network using IPv4 and IPv6. Each switch comes with one SVI appearing in the default configuration “out-of-the-box.” The default SVI is interface VLAN1.</p></div>
<p><strong>7. Match the descriptions to the terms. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>A GUI, or graphical user interface, allows the user to interact with the operating system by pointing and clicking at elements on the screen. A CLI, or command-line interface, requires users to type commands at a prompt in order to interact with the OS. The shell is the part of the operating system that is closest to the user. The kernel is the part of the operating system that interfaces with the hardware.</p></div></p>
<p><strong>8. What happens when a switch receives a frame and the calculated CRC value is different than the value that is in the FCS field?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The switch notifies the source of the bad frame.</li>
<li>The switch places the new CRC value in the FCS field and forwards the frame.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The switch drops the frame.</span></strong></li>
<li>The switch floods the frame to all ports except the port through which the frame arrived to notify the hosts of the error.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>The purpose of the CRC value in the FCS field is to determine if the frame has errors. If the frame does have errors, then the frame is dropped by the switch.</p></div>
<p><strong>9. Two network engineers are discussing the methods used to forward frames through a switch. What is an important concept related to the cut-through method of switching?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The fragment-free switching offers the lowest level of latency.</li>
<li>Fast-forward switching can be viewed as a compromise between store-and-forward switching and fragment-free switching.</li>
<li>Fragment-free switching is the typical cut-through method of switching.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Packets can be relayed with errors when fast-forward switching is used.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> Fast-forward switching offers the lowest level of latency and it is the typical cut-through method of switching. Fragment-free switching can be viewed as a compromise between store-and-forward switching and fast-forward switching. Because fast-forward switching starts forwarding before the entire packet has been received, there may be times when packets are relayed with errors.</p></div>
<p><strong>10. Which two issues can cause both runts and giants in Ethernet networks? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>using the incorrect cable type</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">half-duplex operations</span></strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a malfunctioning NIC</strong></span></li>
<li>electrical interference on serial interfaces</li>
<li>CRC errors</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> Because collisions are a normal aspect of half-duplex communications, runt and giant frames are common by-products of those operations. A malfunctioning NIC can also place frames on the network that are either too short or longer than the maximum allowed length. CRC errors can result from using the wrong type of cable or from electrical interference. Using a cable that is too long can result in late collisions rather than runts and giants.</p></div><br />
<strong>11. Which two functions are performed at the LLC sublayer of the OSI Data Link Layer to facilitate Ethernet communication? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>implements CSMA/CD over legacy shared half-duplex media</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>enables IPv4 and IPv6 to utilize the same physical medium</strong></span></li>
<li>integrates Layer 2 flows between 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and 1 Gigabit Ethernet over copper</li>
<li>implements a process to delimit fields within an Ethernet 2 frame</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>places information in the Ethernet frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being encapsulated by the frame</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other case</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>responsible for internal structure of Ethernet frame</li>
<li>applies source and destination MAC addresses to Ethernet frame</li>
<li>integrates Layer 2 flows between 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and 1 Gigabit Ethernet over copper</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>enables IPv4 and IPv6 to utilize the same physical medium</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>handles communication between upper layer networking software and Ethernet NIC hardware</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other case</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>adds Ethernet control information to network protocol data</strong></span></li>
<li>responsible for internal structure of Ethernet frame</li>
<li>implements trailer with frame check sequence for error detection</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>enables IPv4 and IPv6 to utilize the same physical medium</strong></span></li>
<li>applies source and destination MAC addresses to Ethernet frame</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other case</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>implements CSMA/CD over legacy shared half-duplex media</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>adds Ethernet control information to network protocol data</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>places information in the Ethernet frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being encapsulated by the frame</strong></span></li>
<li>applies source and destination MAC addresses to Ethernet frame</li>
<li>integrates Layer 2 flows between 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and 1 Gigabit Ethernet over copper</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data link layer is actually divided into two sublayers:</p>
<p>+ Logical Link Control (LLC): This upper sublayer defines the software processes that provide services to the network layer protocols. It places information in the frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being used for the frame. This information allows multiple Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6, to utilize the same network interface and media.<br />
+ Media Access Control (MAC): This lower sublayer defines the media access processes performed by the hardware. It provides data link layer addressing and delimiting of data according to the physical signaling requirements of the medium and the type of data link layer protocol in use.</p></div>
<p><strong>12. Which two commands could be used to check if DNS name resolution is working properly on a Windows PC? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">nslookup cisco.com</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ping cisco.com</span></strong></li>
<li>ipconfig /flushdns</li>
<li>net cisco.com</li>
<li>nbtstat cisco.com</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> The ping command tests the connection between two hosts. When ping uses a host domain name to test the connection, the resolver on the PC will first perform the name resolution to query the DNS server for the IP address of the host. If the ping command is unable to resolve the domain name to an IP address, an error will result.</p>
<p>Nslookup is a tool for testing and troubleshooting DNS servers.</p></div>
<p><strong>13. A small advertising company has a web server that provides critical business service. The company connects to the Internet through a leased line service to an ISP. Which approach best provides cost effective redundancy for the Internet connection?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add a second NIC to the web server.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Add a connection to the Internet via a DSL line to another ISP.</span></strong></li>
<li>Add another web server to prepare failover support.</li>
<li>Add multiple connections between the switches and the edge router.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> With a separate DSL connection to another ISP, the company will have a redundancy solution for the Internet connection, in case the leased line connection fails. The other options provide other aspects of redundancy, but not the Internet connection. The options of adding a second NIC and adding multiple connections between the switches and the edge router will provide redundancy in case one NIC fails or one connection between the switches and the edge router fails. The option of adding another web server provides redundancy if the main web server fails.</p></div>
<p><strong>14. Only employees connected to IPv6 interfaces are having difficulty connecting to remote networks. The analyst wants to verify that IPv6 routing has been enabled. What is the best command to use to accomplish the task?</strong></p>

</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>For Layer 2 functions, Ethernet relies on logical link control (LLC) and MAC sublayers to operate at the data link layer. FCS (Frame Check Sequence) and SFD (Start Frame Delimiter) are fields of the Ethernet frame. CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) is the technology Ethernet uses to manage shared media access.</p></div>
<p><strong>30. A network team is comparing topologies for connecting on a shared media. Which physical topology is an example of a hybrid topology for a LAN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bus</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">extended star</span></strong></li>
<li>ring</li>
<li>partial mesh</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>An extended star topology is an example of a hybrid topology as additional switches are interconnected with other star topologies. A partial mesh topology is a common hybrid WAN topology. The bus and ring are not hybrid topology types.</p></div><br />
<strong>31. Given network 172.18.109.0, which subnet mask would be used if 6 host bits were available?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>255.255.192.0</li>
<li>255.255.224.0</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">255.255.255.192</span></strong></li>
<li>255.255.255.248</li>
<li>255.255.255.252</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong><br />
With an IPv4 network, the subnet mask is determined by the hosts bits that are required:<br />
11 host bits required – 255.255.248.0<br />
10 host bits required – 255.255.252.0<br />
9 host bits required – 255.255.254.0<br />

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>To calculate any of these addresses, write the device IP address in binary. Draw a line showing where the subnet mask 1s end. For example, with Device 1, the final octet (77) is 01001101. The line would be drawn between the 0100 and the 1101 because the subnet mask is /28. Change all the bits to the right of the line to 0s to determine the network number (01000000 or 64). Change all the bits to the right of the line to 1s to determine the broadcast address (01001111 or 79).</p></div><br />
<strong>33. What type of address is 198.133.219.162?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>link-local</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>public</strong></span></li>
<li>loopback</li>
<li>multicast</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>34. What does the IP address 192.168.1.15/29 represent?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>subnetwork address</li>
<li>unicast address</li>
<li>multicast address</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">broadcast address</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>A broadcast address is the last address of any given network. This address cannot be assigned to a host, and it is used to communicate with all hosts on that network.</p></div><br />
<strong>35. Why is NAT not needed in IPv6?​</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because IPv6 has integrated security, there is no need to hide the IPv6 addresses of internal networks.​</li>
<li>The problems that are induced by NAT applications are solved because the IPv6 header improves packet handling by intermediate routers.​</li>
<li>The end-to-end connectivity problems that are caused by NAT are solved because the number of routes increases with the number of nodes that are connected to the Internet.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Any host or user can get a public IPv6 network address because the number of available IPv6 addresses is extremely large.​</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> The large number of public IPv6 addresses eliminates the need for NAT. Sites from the largest enterprises to single households can get public IPv6 network addresses. This avoids some of the NAT-induced application problems that are experienced by applications that require end-to-end connectivity.</p></div>
<p><strong>36. What routing table entry has a next hop address associated with a destination network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>directly-connected routes</li>
<li>local routes</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">remote routes</span></strong></li>
<li>C and L source routes</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>Routing table entries for remote routes will have a next hop IP address. The next hop IP address is the address of the router interface of the next device to be used to reach the destination network. Directly-connected and local routes have no next hop, because they do not require going through another router to be reached.</p></div><br />
<strong>37. Which term describes a field in the IPv4 packet header that contains a unicast, multicast, or broadcast address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">destination IPv4 address</span></strong></li>
<li>protocol</li>
<li>TTL</li>
<li>header checksum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>38. If the default gateway is configured incorrectly on the host, what is the impact on communications?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no impact on communications.</li>
<li>The host is unable to communicate on the local network.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The host can communicate with other hosts on the local network, but is unable to communicate with hosts on remote networks.</span></strong></li>
<li>The host can communicate with other hosts on remote networks, but is unable to communicate with hosts on the local network.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> A default gateway is only required to communicate with devices on another network. The absence of a default gateway does not affect connectivity between devices on the same local network.</p></div>
<p><strong>39. Which is the compressed format of the IPv6 address fe80:0000:0000:0000:0220:0b3f:f0e0:0029?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>In the IPv6 address scheme, the network of fe80::/10 is reserved for link-local addresses. The address fe80::/64 is a network address that indicates, in this workstation, fe80::/64 is actually used for link-local addresses. Thus the address fe80::30d0:115:3f57:fe4c/128 is a valid IPv6 link-local address.</p></div><br />

<p><strong>45. Refer to the exhibit. The exhibit shows a small switched network and the contents of the MAC address table of the switch. PC1 has sent a frame addressed to PC3. What will the switch do with the frame?</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/45_i275394v1n1_207267.png" alt="" width="583" height="357" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45392" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/45_i275394v1n1_207267.png 583w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/45_i275394v1n1_207267-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The switch will discard the frame.</li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame to all ports.</li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame only to port 2.</li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame only to ports 1 and 3.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The switch will forward the frame to all ports except port 4.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> The MAC address of PC3 is not present in the MAC table of the switch. Because the switch does not know where to send the frame that is addressed to PC3, it will forward the frame to all the switch ports, except for port 4, which is the incoming port.</p></div><br />
<strong>46. Which destination address is used in an ARP request frame?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0.0.0.0</li>
<li>255.255.255.255</li>
<li>the physical address of the destination host</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">FFFF.FFFF.FFFF</span></strong></li>
<li>AAAA.AAAA.AAAA</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong><br />
The purpose of an ARP request is to find the MAC address of the destination host on an Ethernet LAN. The ARP process sends a Layer 2 broadcast to all devices on the Ethernet LAN. The frame contains the IP address of the destination and the broadcast MAC address, FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. The host with the IP address that matches the IP address in the ARP request will reply with a unicast frame that includes the MAC address of the host. Thus the original sending host will obtain the destination IP and MAC address pair to continue the encapsulation process for data transmission.</p></div>
<p><strong>47. Refer to the exhibit. PC1 issues an ARP request because it needs to send a packet to PC3. In this scenario, what will happen next?</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/47_i209820v1n1_209820.png" alt="" width="528" height="295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45391" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/47_i209820v1n1_209820.png 528w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/47_i209820v1n1_209820-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>SW1 will send an ARP reply with its Fa0/1 MAC address.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RT1 will send an ARP reply with its own Fa0/0 MAC address.</span></strong></li>
<li>RT1 will forward the ARP request to PC3.</li>
<li>RT1 will send an ARP reply with the PC3 MAC address.</li>
<li>RT1 will send an ARP reply with its own Fa0/1 MAC address.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> When a network device has to communicate with a device on another network, it broadcasts an ARP request asking for the default gateway MAC address. The default gateway (RT1) unicasts an ARP reply with the Fa0/0 MAC address.</p></div>
<p><strong>48. A network administrator is issuing the login block-for 180 attempts 2 within 30 command on a router. Which threat is the network administrator trying to prevent?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a user who is trying to guess a password to access the router</span></strong></li>
<li>a worm that is attempting to access another part of the network</li>
<li>an unidentified individual who is trying to access the network equipment room</li>
<li>a device that is trying to inspect the traffic on a link</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>The login block-for 180 attempts 2 within 30 command will cause the device to block authentication after 2 unsuccessful attempts within 30 seconds for a duration of 180 seconds. A device inspecting the traffic on a link has nothing to do with the router. The router configuration cannot prevent unauthorized access to the equipment room. A worm would not attempt to access the router to propagate to another part of the network.</p></div><br />
<strong>49. Which statement describes the characteristics of packet-filtering and stateful firewalls as they relate to the OSI model?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A packet-filtering firewall uses session layer information to track the state of a connection, whereas a stateful firewall uses application layer information to track the state of a connection.</li>
<li>Both stateful and packet-filtering firewalls can filter at the application layer.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A packet-filtering firewall typically can filter up to the transport layer, whereas a stateful firewall can filter up to the session layer.</span></strong></li>
<li>A stateful firewall can filter application layer information, whereas a packet-filtering firewall cannot filter beyond the network layer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong> Packet filtering firewalls can always filter Layer 3 content and sometimes TCP and UDP-based content. Stateful firewalls monitor connections and thus have to be able to support up to the session layer of the OSI model.</p></div>
