<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It requires a VPN gateway at each end of the tunnel to encrypt and decrypt traffic.</strong></span></li>
<li>It requires the placement of a VPN server at the edge of the company network.</li>
<li>It requires a client/server architecture.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Site-to-site VPNs are static and are used to connect entire networks. Hosts have no knowledge of the VPN and send TCP/IP traffic to VPN gateways. The VPN gateway is responsible for encapsulating the traffic and forwarding it through the VPN tunnel to a peer gateway at the other end which decapsulates the traffic.</p></div>
<p><strong>46. Which statement describes an important characteristic of a site-to-site VPN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It must be statically set up.</strong></span></li>
<li>After the initial connection is established, it can dynamically change connection information.</li>
<li>It requires using a VPN client on the host PC.</li>
<li>It is commonly implemented over dialup and cable modem networks.</li>
<li>It is ideally suited for use by mobile workers.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A site-to-site VPN is created between the network devices of two separate networks. The VPN is static and stays established. The internal hosts of the two networks have no knowledge of the VPN.</p></div>
<p><strong>47. Which protocol is attacked when a cybercriminal provides an invalid gateway in order to create a man-in-the-middle attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DHCP</strong></span></li>
<li>ICMP</li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>HTTP or HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A cybercriminal could set up a rogue DHCP server that provides one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong default gateway that is used to create a man-in-the-middle attack and allow the attacker to intercept data</li>
<li>Wrong DNS server that results in the user being sent to a malicious website</li>
<li>Invalid default gateway IP address that results in a denial of service attack on the DHCP client</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>48. In which TCP attack is the cybercriminal attempting to overwhelm a target host with half-open TCP connections?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reset attack</li>
<li>session hijacking attack</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SYN flood attack</strong></span></li>
<li>port scan attack</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> In a TCP SYN flood attack, the attacker sends to the target host a continuous flood of TCP SYN session requests with a spoofed source IP address. The target host responds with a TCP-SYN-ACK to each of the SYN session requests and waits for a TCP ACK that will never arrive. Eventually the target is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections.</p></div>
<p><strong>49. Which statement describes a VPN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VPNs use logical connections to create public networks through the Internet.</li>
<li>VPNs use open source virtualization software to create the tunnel through the Internet.</li>
<li>VPNs use dedicated physical connections to transfer data between remote users.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>VPNs use virtual connections to create a private network through a public network.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A VPN is a private network that is created over a public network. Instead of using dedicated physical connections, a VPN uses virtual connections routed through a public network between two network devices.</p></div>
