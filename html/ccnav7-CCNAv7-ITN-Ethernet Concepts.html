<li>exchanging frames between nodes over physical network media</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Why are two strands of fiber used for a single fiber optic connection?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The two strands allow the data to travel for longer distances without degrading.</li>
<li>They prevent crosstalk from causing interference on the connection.</li>
<li>They increase the speed at which the data can travel.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They allow for full-duplex connectivity.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Which characteristic describes crosstalk?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the distortion of the network signal from fluorescent lighting</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the distortion of the transmitted messages from signals carried in adjacent wires</strong></span></li>
<li>the weakening of the network signal over long cable lengths</li>
<li>the loss of wireless signal over excessive distance from the access point</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Which procedure is used to reduce the effect of crosstalk in copper cables?</strong></p>

<p><strong>6. A network administrator is measuring the transfer of bits across the company backbone for a mission critical financial application. The administrator notices that the network throughput appears lower than the bandwidth expected. Which three factors could influence the differences in throughput? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the amount of traffic that is currently crossing the network</span></strong></li>
<li>the sophistication of the encapsulation method applied to the data</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the type of traffic that is crossing the network</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the latency that is created by the number of network devices that the data is crossing</strong></span></li>
<li>the bandwidth of the WAN connection to the Internet</li>
<li>the reliability of the gigabit Ethernet infrastructure of the backbone</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Throughput usually does not match the specified bandwidth of physical links due to multiple factors. These factors include, the amount of traffic, type of traffic, and latency created by the network devices the data has to cross.</p></div><br />
<strong>7. What are two characteristics of fiber-optic cable? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is not affected by EMI or RFI.</span></strong></li>
<li>Each pair of cables is wrapped in metallic foil.</li>
<li>It combines the technique of cancellation, shielding, and twisting to protect data.</li>
<li>It typically contains 4 pairs of fiber-optic wires.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is more expensive than UTP cabling is.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Fiber-optic cabling supports higher bandwidth than UTP for longer distances. Fiber is immune to EMI and RFI, but costs more, requires more skill to install, and requires more safety precautions.</p></div><br />
<strong>8. What is a primary role of the Physical layer in transmitting data on the network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">create the signals that represent the bits in each frame on to the media</span></strong></li>
<li>provide physical addressing to the devices</li>
<li>determine the path packets take through the network</li>
<li>control data access to the media</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The OSI physical layer provides the means to transport the bits that make up a frame across the network media. This layer accepts a complete frame from the data link layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted to the local media.</p></div>
<p><strong>9. With the use of unshielded twisted-pair copper wire in a network, what causes crosstalk within the cable pairs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the magnetic field around the adjacent pairs of wire</span></strong></li>
<li>the use of braided wire to shield the adjacent wire pairs</li>
<li>the reflection of the electrical wave back from the far end of the cable</li>
<li>the collision caused by two nodes trying to use the media simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Crosstalk is a type of noise, or interference that occurs when signal transmission on one wire interferes with another wire. When current flows through a wire a magnetic field is produced. The produced magnetic field will interface the signal carried in the adjacent wire.</p></div>
<p><strong>10. Refer to the graphic. What type of cabling is shown?</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" class="wp-image-37462 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-01-11_180314-300x234-1.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="171" /></p>
<ul>
<li>STP</li>
<li>UTP</li>
<li>coax</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>fiber</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Network cabling include different types of cables:</p>
<ul>
<li>UTP cable consists of four pairs of color-coded wires that have been twisted together and then encased in a flexible plastic sheath.</li>
<li>STP cable uses four pairs of wires, each wrapped in a foil shield, which are then wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil.</li>
<li>Coaxial cable uses a copper conductor and a layer of flexible plastic insulation surrounds the copper conductor.</li>
<li>Fiber cable is a flexible, extremely thin, transparent strand of glass surrounded by plastic insulation.</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>11. In addition to the cable length, what two factors could interfere with the communication carried over UTP cables? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">crosstalk</span></strong></li>
<li>bandwidth</li>
<li>size of the network</li>
<li>signal modulation technique</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>electromagnetic interference</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Copper media is widely used in network communications. However, copper media is limited by distance and signal interference. Data is transmitted on copper cables as electrical pulses. The electrical pulses are susceptible to interference from two sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI)</strong> &#8211; EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt the data signals being carried by copper media.</li>
<li><strong>Crosstalk</strong> &#8211; Crosstalk is a disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of a signal on one wire interfering with the signal in an adjacent wire.</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>12. Refer to the graphic. What type of cabling is shown?</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-37463 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-01-11_180547.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="173" /></p>
<ul>

<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">UTP</span></strong></li>
<li>coax</li>
<li>fiber</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. Which two devices commonly affect wireless networks? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blu-ray players</li>
<li>home theaters</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">cordless phones</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">microwaves</span></strong></li>
<li>incandescent light bulbs</li>
<li>external hard drives</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is the interference that is caused by radio transmitters and other devices that are transmitting in the same frequency.</p></div>
<p><strong>14. Which two statements describe the services provided by the data link layer? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It defines the end-to-end delivery addressing scheme.</li>
<li>It maintains the path between the source and destination devices during the data transmission.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It manages the access of frames to the network media.</span></strong></li>
<li>It provides reliable delivery through link establishment and flow control.</li>
<li>It ensures that application data will be transmitted according to the prioritization.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It packages various Layer 3 PDUs into a frame format that is compatible with the network interface.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data link layer is divided into two sub layers, namely Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). LLC forms a frame from the network layer PDU into a format that conforms to the requirements of the network interface and media. A network layer PDU might be for IPv4 or IPv6. The MAC sub layer defines the media access processes performed by the hardware. It manages the frame access to the network media according to the physical signaling requirements (copper cable, fiber optic, wireless, etc.)</p></div>
<p><strong>15. What is the function of the CRC value that is found in the FCS field of a frame?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to verify the integrity of the received frame</span></strong></li>
<li>to verify the physical address in the frame</li>
<li>to verify the logical address in the frame</li>
<li>to compute the checksum header for the data field in the frame</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The CRC value in the FCS field of the received frame is compared to the computed CRC value of that frame, in order to verify the integrity of the frame. If the two values do not match, then the frame is discarded.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. What is contained in the trailer of a data-link frame?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>logical address</li>
<li>physical address</li>
<li>data</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">error detection</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The trailer in a data-link frame contains error detection information that is pertinent to the frame included in the FCS field. The header contains control information, such as the addressing, while the area that is indicated by the word &#8220;data&#8221; includes the data, transport layer PDU, and the IP header.</p></div>
<p><strong>17. Which statement describes a characteristic of the frame header fields of the data link layer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They all include the flow control and logical connection fields.</li>
<li>Ethernet frame header fields contain Layer 3 source and destination addresses.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They vary depending on protocols.</span></strong></li>
<li>They include information on user applications.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All data link layer protocols encapsulate the Layer 3 PDU within the data field of the frame. However, the structure of the frame and the fields that are contained in the header vary according to the protocol. Different data link layer protocols may use different fields, like priority/quality of service, logical connection control, physical link control, flow control, and congestion control.</p></div>
<p><strong>18. A network team is comparing physical WAN topologies for connecting remote sites to a headquarters building. Which topology provides high availability and connects some, but not all, remote sites?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mesh</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">partial mesh</span></strong></li>
<li>hub and spoke</li>
<li>point-to-point</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Partial mesh topologies provide high availability by interconnecting multiple remote sites, but do not require a connection between all remote sites. A mesh topology requires point-to-point links with every system being connected to every other system. A point-to-point topology is where each device is connected to one other device. A hub and spoke uses a central device in a star topology that connects to other point-to-point devices.</p></div>
<p><strong>19. Which two fields or features does Ethernet examine to determine if a received frame is passed to the data link layer or discarded by the NIC? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>auto-MDIX</li>
<li>CEF</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Frame Check Sequence</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">minimum frame size</span></strong></li>
<li>source MAC address</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> An Ethernet frame is not processed and is discarded if it is smaller than the minimum (64 bytes) or if the calculated frame check sequence (FCS) value does not match the received FCS value. Auto-MDIX (automatic medium-dependent interface crossover) is Layer 1 technology that detects cable straight-through or crossover types. The source MAC address is not used to determine how the frame is received. CEF (Cisco Express Forwarding) is a technology used to expedite Layer 3 switching.</p></div>
<p><strong>20. Which media communication type does not require media arbitration in the data link layer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>deterministic</li>
<li>half-duplex</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">full-duplex</span></strong></li>
<li>controlled access</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Half-duplex communication occurs when both devices can both transmit and receive on the medium but cannot do so simultaneously. Full-duplex communication occurs when both devices can transmit and receive on the medium at the same time and therefore does not require media arbitration. Half-duplex communication is typically contention-based, whereas controlled (deterministic) access is applied in technologies where devices take turns to access the medium.</p></div>
<p><strong>21. Which statement describes an extended star topology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>End devices connect to a central intermediate device, which in turn connects to other central intermediate devices.</strong></span></li>
<li>End devices are connected together by a bus and each bus connects to a central intermediate device.</li>
<li>Each end system is connected to its respective neighbor via an intermediate device.</li>
<li>All end and intermediate devices are connected in a chain to each other.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In an extended star topology, central intermediate devices interconnect other star topologies.</p></div>
<p><strong>22. What is a characteristic of the LLC sublayer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It provides the logical addressing required that identifies the device.</li>
<li>It provides delimitation of data according to the physical signaling requirements of the medium.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It places information in the frame allowing multiple Layer 3 protocols to use the same network interface and media.</strong></span></li>
<li>It defines software processes that provide services to the physical layer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The Logical Link Control (LLC) defines the software processes that provide services to the network layer protocols. The information is placed by LLC in the frame and identifies which network layer protocol is being used for the frame. This information allows multiple Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6, to utilize the same network interface and media.</p></div>
<p><strong>23. What are three ways that media access control is used in networking? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethernet utilizes CSMA/CD.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Media access control provides placement of data frames onto the media.</span></strong></li>
<li>Contention-based access is also known as deterministic.</li>
<li>802.11 utilizes CSMA/CD.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Data link layer protocols define the rules for access to different media.</span></strong></li>
<li>Networks with controlled access have reduced performance due to data collisions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Wired Ethernet networks use CSMA/CD for media access control. IEEE 802.11 wireless networks use CSMA/CA, a similar method. Media access control defines the way data frames get placed on the media. The controlled access method is deterministic, not a contention-based access to networks. Because each device has its own time to use the medium, controlled access networks such as legacy Token Ring do not have collisions.</p></div>
<p><strong>24. During the encapsulation process, what occurs at the data link layer for a PC connected to an Ethernet network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An IP address is added.</li>
<li>The logical address is added.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The physical address is added.</span></strong></li>
<li>The process port number is added.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Ethernet frame includes the source and destination physical address. The trailer includes a CRC value in the Frame Check Sequence field to allow the receiving device to determine if the frame has been changed (has errors) during the transmission.</p></div>
<p><strong>25. What three items are contained in an Ethernet header and trailer? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>source IP address</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">source MAC address</span></strong></li>
<li>destination IP address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>destination MAC address</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>error-checking information</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Layer 2 headers contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame start and stop indicator flags at the beginning and end of a frame</li>
<li>Addressing &#8211; for Ethernet networks this part of the header contains source and destination MAC addresses</li>
<li>Type field to indicate what Layer 3 protocol is being used</li>
<li>Error detection to determine if the frame arrived without error</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>26. What type of communication rule would best describe CSMA/CD?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">access method</span></strong></li>
<li>flow control</li>
<li>message encapsulation</li>
<li>message encoding</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Carrier sense multiple access collision detection (CSMA/CD) is the access method used with Ethernet. The access method rule of communication dictates how a network device is able to place a signal on the carrier. CSMA/CD dictates those rules on an Ethernet network and CSMA/CA dictates those rules on an 802.11 wireless LAN.</p></div>
<p><strong>27. Which three basic parts are common to all frame types supported by the data link layer? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">header</span></strong></li>
<li>type field</li>
<li>MTU size</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>data</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>trailer</strong></span></li>
<li>CRC value</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data link protocol is responsible for NIC-to-NIC communications within the same network. Although there are many different data link layer protocols that describe data link layer frames, each frame type has three basic parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Trailer</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>28. Which statement is true about the CSMA/CD access method that is used in Ethernet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a device hears a carrier signal and transmits, a collision cannot occur.</li>
<li>A jamming signal causes only devices that caused the collision to execute a backoff algorithm.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">All network devices must listen before transmitting.</span></strong></li>
<li>Devices involved in a collision get priority to transmit after the backoff period.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Legacy bus-topology Ethernet LAN uses CSMA/CD as network media access control protocol. It works by detecting a collision in the medium and backing off (after transmitting a jam signal) as necessary. When one host wants to transmit a frame, it listens on the medium to check if the medium is busy. After it senses that no one else is transmitting, the host starts transmitting the frame, it also monitors the current level to detect a collision. If it detects a collision, it transmits a special jam signal so that all other hosts can know there was a collision. The other host will receive this jam signal and stop transmitting. After this, both hosts enter an exponential backoff phase and retry transmission.</p></div>
<p><strong>29. What is the auto-MDIX feature on a switch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the automatic configuration of an interface for 10/100/1000 Mb/s operation</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the automatic configuration of an interface for a straight-through or a crossover Ethernet cable connection</strong></span></li>
<li>the automatic configuration of full-duplex operation over a single Ethernet copper or optical cable</li>
<li>the ability to turn a switch interface on or off accordingly if an active connection is detected</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The auto-MDIX enables a switch to use a crossover or a straight-through Ethernet cable to connect to a device regardless of the device on the other end of the connection.</p></div>
<p><strong>30. Refer to the exhibit. What is the destination MAC address of the Ethernet frame as it leaves the web server if the final destination is PC1?</strong></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-37464" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i209881v1n2_209881.png" alt="" width="478" height="278" /></p>
<ul>
<li>00-60-2F-3A-07-AA</li>
<li>00-60-2F-3A-07-BB</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">00-60-2F-3A-07-CC</span></strong></li>
<li>00-60-2F-3A-07-DD</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The destination MAC address is used for local delivery of Ethernet frames. The MAC (Layer 2) address changes at each network segment along the path. As the frame leaves the web server, it will be delivered by using the MAC address of the default gateway.</p></div>
<p><strong>31. A Layer 2 switch is used to switch incoming frames from a 1000BASE-T port to a port connected to a 100Base-T network. Which method of memory buffering would work best for this task?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>port-based buffering</li>
<li>level 1 cache buffering</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">shared memory buffering</span></strong></li>
<li>fixed configuration buffering</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> With shared memory buffering, the number of frames stored in the buffer is restricted only by the of the entire memory buffer and not limited to a single port buffer. This permits larger frames to be transmitted with fewer dropped frames. This is important to asymmetric switching, which applies to this scenario, where frames are being exchanged between ports of different rates. With port-based memory buffering, frames are stored in queues that are linked to specific incoming and outgoing ports making it possible for a single frame to delay the transmission of all the frames in memory because of a busy destination port. Level 1 cache is memory used in a CPU. Fixed configuration refers to the port arrangement in switch hardware.</p></div><br />
<strong>32. What are two examples of the cut-through switching method? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>store-and-forward switching</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">fast-forward switching</span></strong></li>
<li>CRC switching</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">fragment-free switching</span></strong></li>
<li>QOS switching</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Store-and forward switching accepts the entire frame and performs error checking using CRC before forwarding the frame. Store-and-forward is often required for QOS analysis. Fast-forward and fragment-free are both variations of the cut-through switching method where only part of the frame is received before the switch begins to forward it.</p></div><br />
<strong>33. Which frame forwarding method receives the entire frame and performs a CRC check to detect errors before forwarding the frame?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cut-through switching</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">store-and-forward switching</span></strong></li>
<li>fragment-free switching</li>
<li>fast-forward switching</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Fast-forward and fragment-free switching are variations of cut-through switching, which begins to forward the frame before the entire frame is received.</p></div>
<p><strong>34. What is the purpose of the FCS field in a frame?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to obtain the MAC address of the sending node</li>
<li>to verify the logical address of the sending node</li>
<li>to compute the CRC header for the data field</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to determine if errors occurred in the transmission and reception</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The FCS field in a frame is used to detect any errors in the transmission and receipt of a frame. This is done by comparing the CRC value within the frame against a computed CRC value of the frame. If the two values do not match, then the frame is discarded.</p></div>
<p><strong>35. Which switching method has the lowest level of latency?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cut-through</li>
<li>store-and-forward</li>
<li>fragment-free</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">fast-forward</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Fast-forward switching begins to forward a frame after reading the destination MAC address, resulting in the lowest latency. Fragment-free reads the first 64 bytes before forwarding. Store-and-forward has the highest latency because it reads the entire frame before beginning to forward it. Both fragment-free and fast-forward are types of cut-through switching.</p></div>
<p><strong>36. A network administrator is connecting two modern switches using a straight-through cable. The switches are new and have never been configured. Which three statements are correct about the final result of the connection? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The link between the switches will work at the fastest speed that is supported by both switches.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The link between switches will work as full-duplex.</strong></span></li>
<li>If both switches support different speeds, they will each work at their own fastest speed.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The auto-MDIX feature will configure the interfaces eliminating the need for a crossover cable.</strong></span></li>
<li>The connection will not be possible unless the administrator changes the cable to a crossover cable.</li>
<li>The duplex capability has to be manually configured because it cannot be negotiated.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Modern switches can negotiate to work in full-duplex mode if both switches are capable. They will negotiate to work using the fastest possible speed and the auto-MDIX feature is enabled by default, so a cable change is not needed.</p></div>
<p><strong>37. Which advantage does the store-and-forward switching method have compared with the cut-through switching method?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>collision detecting</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">frame error checking</span></strong></li>
<li>faster frame forwarding</li>
<li>frame forwarding using IPv4 Layer 3 and 4 information</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A switch using the store-and-forward switching method performs an error check on an incoming frame by comparing the FCS value against its own FCS calculations after the entire frame is received. In comparison, a switch using the cut-through switching method makes quick forwarding decisions and starts the forwarding process without waiting for the entire frame to be received. Thus a switch using cut-through switching may send invalid frames to the network. The performance of store-and-forward switching is slower compared to cut-through switching performance. Collision detection is monitored by the sending device. Store-and-forward switching does not use IPv4 Layer 3 and 4 information for its forwarding decisions.</p></div>
<p><strong>38. When the store-and-forward method of switching is in use, what part of the Ethernet frame is used to perform an error check?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">CRC in the trailer</span></strong></li>
<li>source MAC address in the header</li>
<li>destination MAC address in the header</li>
<li>protocol type in the header</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) part of the trailer is used to determine if the frame has been modified during transit.​ If the integrity of the frame is verified, the frame is forwarded. If the integrity of the frame cannot be verified, then the frame is dropped.</p></div><br />
<strong>39. Which switching method uses the CRC value in a frame?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cut-through</li>
<li>fast-forward</li>
<li>fragment-free</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">store-and-forward</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When the store-and-forward switching method is used, the switch receives the complete frame before forwarding it on to the destination. The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) part of the trailer is used to determine if the frame has been modified during transit.​​ In contrast, a cut-through switch forwards the frame once the destination Layer 2 address is read. Two types of cut-through switching methods are fast-forward and fragment-free.</p></div>
<p><strong>40. What are two actions performed by a Cisco switch? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>building a routing table that is based on the first IP address in the frame header</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">using the source MAC addresses of frames to build and maintain a MAC address table</span></strong></li>
<li>forwarding frames with unknown destination IP addresses to the default gateway</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">utilizing the MAC address table to forward frames via the destination MAC address</span></strong></li>
<li>examining the destination MAC address to add new entries to the MAC address table</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Important actions that a switch performs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a frame comes in, the switch examines the Layer 2 source address to build and maintain the Layer 2 MAC address table.</li>
<li>It examines the Layer 2 destination address to determine how to forward the frame. When the destination address is in the MAC address table, then the frame is sent out a particular port. When the address is unknown, the frame is sent to all ports that have devices connected to that network.</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>41. Which two statements describe features or functions of the logical link control sublayer in Ethernet standards? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Logical link control is implemented in software.</span></strong></li>
<li>Logical link control is specified in the IEEE 802.3 standard.</li>
<li>The LLC sublayer adds a header and a trailer to the data.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The data link layer uses LLC to communicate with the upper layers of the protocol suite.</strong></span></li>
<li>The LLC sublayer is responsible for the placement and retrieval of frames on and off the media.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Logical link control is implemented in software and enables the data link layer to communicate with the upper layers of the protocol suite. Logical link control is specified in the IEEE 802.2 standard. IEEE 802.3 is a suite of standards that define the different Ethernet types. The MAC (Media Access Control) sublayer is responsible for the placement and retrieval of frames on and off the media. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for adding a header and a trailer to the network layer protocol data unit (PDU).</p></div>
<p><strong>42. What is the auto-MDIX feature?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It enables a device to automatically configure an interface to use a straight-through or a crossover cable.</strong></span></li>
<li>It enables a device to automatically configure the duplex settings of a segment.</li>
<li>It enables a device to automatically configure the speed of its interface.</li>
<li>It enables a switch to dynamically select the forwarding method.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The auto-MDIX feature allows the device to configure its network port according to the cable type that is used (straight-through or crossover) and the type of device that is connected to that port. When a port of a switch is configured with auto-MDIX, this switch can be connected to another switch by the use of either a straight-through cable or a crossover cable.</p></div><br />
<strong>43. What is one advantage of using the cut-through switching method instead of the store-and-forward switching method?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>has a positive impact on bandwidth by dropping most of the invalid frames</li>
<li>makes a fast forwarding decision based on the source MAC address of the frame</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">has a lower latency appropriate for high-performance computing applications​</span></strong></li>
<li>provides the flexibility to support any mix of Ethernet speeds</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cut-through switching provides lower latency switching for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Cut-through switching allows more invalid frames to cross the network than store-and-forward switching. The cut-through switching method can make a forwarding decision as soon as it looks up the destination MAC address of the frame.</p></div>
<p><strong>44. Which is a multicast MAC address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF</li>
<li>5C-26-0A-4B-19-3E</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">01-00-5E-00-00-03</span></strong></li>
<li>00-26-0F-4B-00-3E</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Multicast MAC addresses begin with the special value of 01-00-5E.</p></div>
<p><strong>45. Refer to the exhibit. What is wrong with the displayed termination?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46075" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i274300v1n1_209630-300x221-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="221" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The woven copper braid should not have been removed.</li>
<li>The wrong type of connector is being used.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The untwisted length of each wire is too long.</span></strong></li>
<li>The wires are too thick for the connector that is used.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a cable to an RJ-45 connector is terminated, it is important to ensure that the untwisted wires are not too long and that the flexible plastic sheath surrounding the wires is crimped down and not the bare wires. None of the colored wires should be visible from the bottom of the jack.</p></div>
<p><strong>46. Refer to the exhibit. The PC is connected to the console port of the switch. All the other connections are made through FastEthernet links. Which types of UTP cables can be used to connect the devices?​</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-37475" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i274301v1n1_206934.png" alt="" width="575" height="121" /></p>
<pre>1 - rollover, 2 - crossover, 3 - straight-through

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1 - rollover, 2 - straight-through, 3 - crossover</span></strong>

1 - crossover, 2 - rollover, 3 - straight-through

1 - crossover, 2 - straight-through, 3 - rollover

</pre>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A straight-through cable is commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router. A crossover cable is used to interconnect similar devices together like switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a router. If a switch has the MDIX capability, a crossover could be used to connect the switch to the router; however, that option is not available. A rollover cable is used to connect to a router or switch console port.</p></div>
