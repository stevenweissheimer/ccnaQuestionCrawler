<p><strong>1. Which feature on a Cisco router permits the forwarding of traffic for which there is no specific route?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>next-hop</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>gateway of last resort</strong></span></li>
<li>route source</li>
<li>outgoing interface</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A default static route is used as a gateway of last resort to forward unknown destination traffic to a next hop/exit interface. The next-hop or exit interface is the destination to send traffic to on a network after the traffic is matched in a router. The route source is the location a route was learned from.</p></div>
<p><strong>2. Which three advantages are provided by static routing? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Static routing does not advertise over the network, thus providing better security.</strong></span></li>
<li>Configuration of static routes is error-free.</li>
<li>Static routes scale well as the network grows.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Static routing typically uses less network bandwidth and fewer CPU operations than dynamic routing does.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The path a static route uses to send data is known.</strong></span></li>
<li>No intervention is required to maintain changing route information.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Static routes are prone to errors from incorrect configuration by the administrator. They do not scale well, because the routes must be manually reconfigured to accommodate a growing network. Intervention is required each time a route change is necessary. They do provide better security, use less bandwidth, and provide a known path to the destination.</p></div>
<p><strong>3. What are two functions of dynamic routing protocols? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to maintain routing tables</strong></span></li>
<li>to assure low router overhead</li>
<li>to avoid exposing network information</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to discover the network</strong></span></li>
<li>to choose the path that is specified by the administrator</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dynamic routing protocols exist to discover the network, maintain routing tables, and calculate the best path. Having low levels of routing overhead, using the path specified by the administrator, and avoiding the exposure of network information are functions of static routing.</p></div>
<p><strong>4. What is an advantage of using dynamic routing protocols instead of static routing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>easier to implement</li>
<li>more secure in controlling routing updates</li>
<li>fewer router resource overhead requirements</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ability to actively search for new routes if the current path becomes unavailable​</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dynamic routing has the ability to search and find a new best path if the current path is no longer available. The other options are actually the advantages of static routing.</p></div>
<p><strong>5. What happens to a static route entry in a routing table when the outgoing interface associated with that route goes into the down state?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The static route is removed from the routing table.</span></strong></li>
<li>The router polls neighbors for a replacement route.</li>
<li>The router automatically redirects the static route to use another interface.</li>
<li>The static route remains in the table because it was defined as static.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When the interface associated with a static route goes down, the router will remove the route because it is no longer valid.</p></div>
<p><strong>6. What is a characteristic of a static route that matches all packets?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It uses a single network address to send multiple static routes to one destination address.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It identifies the gateway IP address to which the router sends all IP packets for which it does not have a learned or static route.</strong></span></li>
<li>It backs up a route already discovered by a dynamic routing protocol.</li>
<li>It is configured with a higher administrative distance than the original dynamic routing protocol has.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A default static route is a route that matches all packets. It identifies the gateway IP address to which the router sends all IP packets for which it does not have a learned or static route. A default static route is simply a static route with 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination IPv4 address. Configuring a default static route creates a gateway of last resort.</p></div>
<p><strong>7. When would it be more beneficial to use a dynamic routing protocol instead of static routing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in an organization where routers suffer from performance issues</li>
<li>on a stub network that has a single exit point</li>
<li>in an organization with a smaller network that is not expected to grow in size</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">on a network where there is a lot of topology changes</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dynamic routing protocols consume more router resources, are suitable for larger networks, and are more useful on networks that are growing and changing.</p></div>
<p><strong>8. Which route would be used to forward a packet with a source IP address of 192.168.10.1 and a destination IP address of 10.1.1.1?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>C 192.168.10.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">O 10.1.1.0/24 [110/65] via 192.168.200.2, 00:01:20, Serial0/1/0</span></strong></li>
<li>S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 172.16.1.1</li>
<li>S 10.1.0.0/16 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Even though OSPF has a higher administrative distance value (less trustworthy), the best match is the route in the routing table that has the most number of far left matching bits.</p></div>
<p><strong>9. Refer to the exhibit. What is the administrative distance value of the route for router R1 to reach the destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:CAFE:4::A?</strong></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37868 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i281319v1n3_281319.png" alt="" width="569" height="200" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i281319v1n3_281319.png 569w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i281319v1n3_281319-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">120</span></strong></li>
<li>110</li>
<li>1</li>
<li>4</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The RIP route with the source code R is used to forward data to the destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:CAFE:4::A. This route has an AD value of 120.</p></div>
<p><strong>10. Which value in a routing table represents trustworthiness and is used by the router to determine which route to install into the routing table when there are multiple routes toward the same destination?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">administrative distance</span></strong></li>
<li>metric</li>
<li>outgoing interface</li>
<li>routing protocol</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The administrative distance represents the trustworthiness of a particular route. The lower an administrative distance, the more trustworthy the learned route is. When a router learns multiple routes toward the same destination, the router uses the administrative distance value to determine which route to place into the routing table. A metric is used by a routing protocol to compare routes received from the routing protocol. An exit interface is the interface used to send a packet in the direction of the destination network. A routing protocol is used to exchange routing updates between two or more adjacent routers.</p></div>
<p><strong>12. Refer to the graphic. Which command would be used on router A to configure a static route to direct traffic from LAN A that is destined for LAN C?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-37869" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215013v1n1_215013.png" alt="" width="449" height="253" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215013v1n1_215013.png 516w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i215013v1n1_215013-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The destination network on LAN C is 192.168.4.0 and the next-hop address from the perspective of router A is 192.168.3.2.</p></div>
<p><strong>13. On which two routers would a default static route be configured? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>any router where a backup route to dynamic routing is needed for reliability</li>
<li>the router that serves as the gateway of last resort</li>
<li>any router running an IOS prior to 12.0</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">stub router connection to the rest of the corporate or campus network</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">edge router connection to the ISP</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A stub router or an edge router connected to an ISP has only one other router as a connection. A default static route works in those situations because all traffic will be sent to one destination. The destination router is the gateway of last resort. The default route is not configured on the gateway, but on the router sending traffic to the gateway. The router IOS does not matter.</p></div>
<p><strong>14. Refer to the exhibit. This network has two connections to the ISP, one via router C and one via router B. The serial link between router A and router C supports EIGRP and is the primary link to the Internet. If the primary link fails, the administrator needs a floating static route that avoids recursive route lookups and any potential next-hop issues caused by the multiaccess nature of the Ethernet segment with router B. What should the administrator configure?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37870" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i223702v1n1_Exhibit1.png" alt="" width="493" height="198" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i223702v1n1_Exhibit1.png 493w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i223702v1n1_Exhibit1-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a static route pointing to 10.1.1.1 with an AD of 95.</li>
<li>Create a fully specified static route pointing to Fa0/0 with an AD of 1.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Create a fully specified static route pointing to Fa0/0 with an AD of 95.</span></strong></li>
<li>Create a static route pointing to 10.1.1.1 with an AD of 1.</li>
<li>Create a static route pointing to Fa0/0 with an AD of 1.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A floating static route is a static route with an administrative distance higher than that of another route already in the routing table. If the route in the table disappears, the floating static route will be put into the routing table in its place. Internal EIGRP has an AD of 90, so a floating static route in this scenario would need to have an AD higher than 90. Also, when creating a static route to a multiaccess interface like a FastEthernet segment a fully specified route should be used, with both a next-hop IP address and an exit interface. This prevents the router from doing a recursive lookup, but still ensures the correct next-hop device on the multiaccess segment forwards the packet.</p></div>
<p><strong>15. What is a characteristic of a floating static route?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it is configured, it creates a gateway of last resort.​</li>
<li>It is used to provide load balancing between static routes.</li>
<li>It is simply a static route with 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination IPv4 address.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is configured with a higher administrative distance than the original dynamic routing protocol has.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Floating static routes are static routes used to provide a backup path to a primary static or dynamic route, in the event of a link failure. They must be configured with a higher administrative distance than the original dynamic routing protocol has. A default static route is simply a static route with 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination IPv4 address. Configuring a default static route creates a gateway of last resort.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. What network prefix and prefix-length combination is used to create a default static route that will match any IPv6 destination?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FFFF::/128</li>
<li>::1/64</li>
<li>::/128</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">::/0</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A default static route configured for IPv6, is a network prefix of all zeros and a prefix mask of 0 which is expressed as ::/0.</p></div>
<p><strong>17. Consider the following command:</strong></p>
<p><em>ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 5</em></p>
<p><strong>What does the 5 at the end of the command signify?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>exit interface</li>
<li>maximum number of hops to the 192.168.10.0/24 network</li>
<li>metric</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">administrative distance</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The 5 at the end of the command signifies administrative distance. This value is added to floating static routes or routes that only appear in the routing table when the preferred route has gone down. The 5 at the end of the command signifies administrative distance configured for the static route. This value indicates that the floating static route will appear in the routing table when the preferred route (with an administrative distance less than 5) is down.</p></div>
<p><strong>18. Refer to the exhibit. The routing table for R2 is as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gateway of last resort is not set</strong></p>
<p>10.0.0.0/30 is subnetted, 2 subnets<br />
C 10.0.0.0 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br />
C 10.0.0.4 is directly connected, Serial0/0/1<br />
192.168.10.0/26 is subnetted, 3 subnets<br />
S 192.168.10.0 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br />
C 192.168.10.64 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0<br />
S 192.168.10.128 [1/0] via 10.0.0.6</p>
<p><strong>What will router R2 do with a packet destined for 192.168.10.129?</strong></p>

<li>drop the packet</li>
<li>send the packet out interface Serial0/0/0</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a static route is configured with the next hop address (as in the case of the 192.168.10.128 network), the output of the <strong>show ip route</strong> command lists the route as &#8220;via&#8221; a particular IP address. The router has to look up that IP address to determine which interface to send the packet out. Because the IP address of 10.0.0.6 is part of network 10.0.0.4, the router sends the packet out interface Serial0/0/1.</p></div>
<p><strong>19. An administrator issues the ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/32 gigabitethernet0/0 2001:db8:acad:6::1 100 command on a router. What administrative distance is assigned to this route?</strong></p>

<li>Configure a dynamic route from R1 to Edge and a static route from Edge to R1.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Two routes have to be created: a default route in R1 to reach Edge and a static route in Edge to reach R1 for the return traffic.

</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A nonrecursive route must have an exit interface specified from which the destination network can be reached. In this example 2001:db8:10:12::/64 is the destination network and R2 will use exit interface S0/0/0 to reach that network.

<li>ip route 172.16.32.0 255.255.0.0 S0/0/0 100</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> OSPF has an administrative distance of 110, so the floating static route must have an administrative distance higher than 110. Because the target network is 172.16.32.0/19, that static route must use the network 172.16.32.0 and a netmask of 255.255.224.0.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A floating static is a backup route that only appears in the routing table when the interface used with the primary route is down.

<li>Send the packet out the GigabitEthernet0/1 interface.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> After a router determines the destination network by ANDing the destination IP address with the subnet mask, the router examines the routing table for the resulting destination network number. When a match is found, the packet is sent to the interface associated with the network number. When no routing table entry is found for the particular network, the default gateway or gateway of last resort (if configured or known) is used. If there is no gateway of last resort, the packet is dropped. In this instance, the 192.168.12.224 network is not found in the routing table and the router uses the gateway of last resort. The gateway of last resort is the IP address of 209.165.200.226. The router knows this is an IP address that is associated with the 209.165.200.224 network. The router then proceeds to transmit the packet out the Serial0/0/0 interface, or the interface that is associated with 209.165.200.224.</p></div>
<p><strong>49. Consider the following command:</strong></p>
<pre>ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 5</pre>
<p>Which route would have to go down in order for this static route to appear in the routing table?</p>
<ul>
<li>a default route</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>a static route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network</strong></span></li>
<li>an OSPF-learned route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network</li>
<li>an EIGRP-learned route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p>The administrative distance of 5 added to the end of the static route creates a floating static situation for a static route that goes down. Static routes have a default administrative distance of 1. This route that has an administrative distance of 5 will not be placed into the routing table unless the previously entered static route to the 192.168.10.0/24 goes down or was never entered. The administrative distance of 5 added to the end of the static route configuration creates a floating static route that will be placed in the routing table when the primary route to the same destination network goes down. By default, a static route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network has an administrative distance of 1. Therefore, the floating route with an administrative distance of 5 will not be placed into the routing table unless the previously entered static route to the 192.168.10.0/24 goes down or was never entered. Because the floating route has an administrative distance of 5, the route is preferred to an OSPF-learned route (with the administrative distance of 110) or an EIGRP-learned route (with the administrative distance of 110) to the same destination network.<br />
</p></div>
<p><strong>50. What are two advantages of static routing over dynamic routing? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Static routing is more secure because it does not advertise over the network.</strong></span></li>
<li>Static routing scales well with expanding networks.</li>
<li>Static routing requires very little knowledge of the network for correct implementation.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Static routing uses fewer router resources than dynamic routing.</strong></span></li>
<li>Static routing is relatively easy to configure for large networks.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p>Static routing requires a thorough understanding of the entire network for proper implementation. It can be prone to errors and does not scale well for large networks. Static routing uses fewer router resources, because no computing is required for updating routes. Static routing can also be more secure because it does not advertise over the network.<br />
</p></div>
<p><strong>51. What characteristic completes the following statement?<br />
When an IPv6 static route is configured, it is possible that the same IPv6 link-local address is used for &#8230; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a destination host route with a /128 prefix.</li>
<li>the “ipv6 unicast-routing” command.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>the next-hop address of two different adjacent routers.</strong></span></li>
<li>an administrative distance of 2.</li>

<p><strong>52. A network administrator configures the interface fa0/0 on the router R1 with the command ip address 172.16.1.254 255.255.255.0. However, when the administrator issues the command show ip route, the routing table does not show the directly connected network. What is the possible cause of the problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The subnet mask is incorrect for the IPv4 address.</li>
<li>The configuration needs to be saved first.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The interface fa0/0 has not been activated.</strong></span></li>
<li>No packets with a destination network of 172.16.1.0 have been sent to R1.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A directly connected network will be added to the routing table when these three conditions are met: (1) the interface is configured with a valid IP address; (2) it is activated with no shutdown command; and (3) it receives a carrier signal from another device that is connected to the interface. An incorrect subnet mask for an IPv4 address will not prevent its appearance in the routing table, although the error may prevent successful communications.</p></div><br />

However, when the administrator issues the command show ip route , the routing table does not show the directly connected network. What is the possible cause of the problem?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The subnet mask is incorrect for the IPv4 address.</li>
<li>No packets with a destination network of 172.16.1.0 have been sent to R1.</li>
<li>The configuration needs to be saved first.</li>

</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A directly connected network will be added to the routing table when these three conditions are met: (1) the interface is configured with a valid IP address; (2) it is activated with no shutdown command; and (3) it receives a carrier signal from another device that is connected to the interface. An incorrect subnet mask for an IPv4 address will not prevent its appearance in the routing table, although the error may prevent successful communications.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Both static and dynamic routing could be used when more than one router is involved. Dynamic routing is when a routing protocol is used. Static routing is when every remote route is entered manually by an administrator into every router in the network topology.</p></div></p>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong> The Router has to look up in the routing table twice to find the exit interface.

This is the 2nd lookup in the table to find out that the packet needs to exit the s0/0/0 interface making the first route a recursive and 2nd route a direct. </p></div>
