<li>application, session, transport, network, data link, and physical layers</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The TCP/IP model contains the application, transport, internet, and network access layers. A file transfer uses the FTP application layer protocol. The data would move from the application layer through all of the layers of the model and across the network to the file server.</p></div>
<p><strong>14. Match the characteristic to the forwarding method. (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/28.png" /></p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A store-and-forward switch always stores the entire frame before forwarding, and checks its CRC and frame length. A cut-through switch can forward frames before receiving the destination address field, thus presenting less latency than a store-and-forward switch. Because the frame can begin to be forwarded before it is completely received, the switch may transmit a corrupt or runt frame. All forwarding methods require a Layer 2 switch to forward broadcast frames.</p></div>
<p><strong>15. Refer to the exhibit. The IP address of which device interface should be used as the default gateway setting of host H1?</strong><br />

<li>guarantees delivery of packets</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a connectionless, best effort protocol. This means that IP requires no end-to-end connection nor does it guarantee delivery of packets. IP is also media independent, which means it operates independently of the network media carrying the packets.<br />

<p><strong>40. An employee of a large corporation remotely logs into the company using the appropriate username and password. The employee is attending an important video conference with a customer concerning a large sale. It is important for the video quality to be excellent during the meeting. The employee is unaware that after a successful login, the connection to the company ISP failed. The secondary connection, however, activated within seconds. The disruption was not noticed by the employee or other employees.<br />
What three network characteristics are described in this scenario? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>security</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>quality of service</strong></span></li>
<li>scalability</li>
<li>powerline networking</li>
<li>integrity</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>fault tolerance</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>41. What are two common causes of signal degradation when using UTP cabling? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>improper termination</strong></span></li>
<li>low-quality shielding in cable</li>
<li>installing cables in conduit</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>low-quality cable or connectors</strong></span></li>
<li>loss of light over long distances</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When terminated improperly, each cable is a potential source of physical layer performance degradation.</p></div>
<p><strong>42. Which subnet would include the address 192.168.1.96 as a usable host address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">192.168.1.64/26</span></strong></li>
<li>192.168.1.32/27</li>
<li>192.168.1.32/28</li>
<li>192.168.1.64/29</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For the subnet of 192.168.1.64/26, there are 6 bits for host addresses, yielding 64 possible addresses. However, the first and last subnets are the network and broadcast addresses for this subnet. Therefore, the range of host addresses for this subnet is 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126. The other subnets do not contain the address 192.168.1.96 as a valid host address.</p></div>
<p><strong>43. Refer to the exhibit. On the basis of the output, which two statements about network connectivity are correct? (Choose two.)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41172 alignnone" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/i275429v1n1_chapter-9-WAN-images2.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="148" /></p>
<ul>
<li>This host does not have a default gateway configured.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There are 4 hops between this device and the device at 192.168.100.1.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There is connectivity between this device and the device at 192.168.100.1.</strong></span></li>
<li>The connectivity between these two hosts allows for videoconferencing calls.</li>
<li>The average transmission time between the two hosts is 2 milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The output displays a successful Layer 3 connection between a host computer and a host at 19.168.100.1. It can be determined that 4 hops exist between them and the average transmission time is 1 milliseconds. Layer 3 connectivity does not necessarily mean that an application can run between the hosts.</p></div>
<p><strong>44. Which two statements describe how to assess traffic flow patterns and network traffic types using a protocol analyzer? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capture traffic on the weekends when most employees are off work.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Capture traffic during peak utilization times to get a good representation of the different traffic types.</strong></span></li>
<li>Only capture traffic in the areas of the network that receive most of the traffic such as the data center.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Perform the capture on different network segments.</strong></span></li>
<li>Only capture WAN traffic because traffic to the web is responsible for the largest amount of traffic on a network.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Traffic flow patterns should be gathered during peak utilization times to get a good representation of the different traffic types. The capture should also be performed on different network segments because some traffic will be local to a particular segment.</p></div>
<p><strong>45. What is the consequence of configuring a router with the <em>ipv6 unicast-routing </em>global configuration command?​</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All router interfaces will be automatically activated.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The IPv6 enabled router interfaces begin sending ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.</strong></span></li>
<li>Each router interface will generate an IPv6 link-local address.​</li>
<li>It statically creates a global unicast address on this router.​</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>46. Which three layers of the OSI model map to the application layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>application</strong></span></li>
<li>network</li>
<li>data link</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>session</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>presentation</strong></span></li>
<li>transport</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: application, transport, internet, and network access. The OSI model consists of seven layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical. The top three layers of the OSI model: application, presentation, and session map to the application layer of the TCP/IP model.</p></div>
<p><strong>47. Refer to the exhibit. If PC1 is sending a packet to PC2 and routing has been configured between the two routers, what will R1 do with the Ethernet frame header attached by PC1?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41173" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/i271152v1n1_271152.png" alt="" width="319" height="268" /></p>
<ul>
<li>nothing, because the router has a route to the destination network</li>
<li>open the header and use it to determine whether the data is to be sent out S0/0/0</li>
<li>open the header and replace the destination MAC address with a new one</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>remove the Ethernet header and configure a new Layer 2 header before sending it out S0/0/0</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When PC1 forms the various headers attached to the data one of those headers is the Layer 2 header. Because PC1 connects to an Ethernet network, an Ethernet header is used. The source MAC address will be the MAC address of PC1 and the destination MAC address will be that of G0/0 on R1. When R1 gets that information, the router removes the Layer 2 header and creates a new one for the type of network the data will be placed onto (the serial link).</p></div>
<p><strong>48. What will happen if the default gateway address is incorrectly configured on a host?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The host cannot communicate with other hosts in the local network.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks.</strong></span></li>
<li>A ping from the host to 127.0.0.1 would not be successful.</li>
<li>The host will have to use ARP to determine the correct address of the default gateway.</li>
<li>The switch will not forward packets initiated by the host.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>49. What are two features of ARP? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a host is encapsulating a packet into a frame, it refers to the MAC address table to determine the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses.</li>
<li>An ARP request is sent to all devices on the Ethernet LAN and contains the IP address of the destination host and its multicast MAC address.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If a host is ready to send a packet to a local destination device and it has the IP address but not the MAC address of the destination, it generates an ARP broadcast.</strong></span></li>
<li>If no device responds to the ARP request, then the originating node will broadcast the data packet to all devices on the network segment.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If a device receiving an ARP request has the destination IPv4 address, it responds with an ARP reply.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>50. A network administrator is adding a new LAN to a branch office. The new LAN must support 90 connected devices. What is the smallest network mask that the network administrator can use for the new network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>255.255.255.128</strong></span></li>
<li>255.255.255.240</li>
<li>255.255.255.248</li>
<li>255.255.255.224</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>51. What are two ICMPv6 messages that are not present in ICMP for IPv4? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Neighbor Solicitation</strong></span></li>
<li>Destination Unreachable</li>
<li>Host Confirmation</li>
<li>Time Exceeded</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Router Advertisement</strong></span></li>
<li>Route Redirection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>52. A client packet is received by a server. The packet has a destination port number of 80. What service is the client requesting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DHCP</li>
<li>SMTP</li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>HTTP</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>53. What is an advantage for small organizations of adopting IMAP instead of POP?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>POP only allows the client to store messages in a centralized way, while IMAP allows distributed storage.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Messages are kept in the mail servers until they are manually deleted from the email client.</strong></span></li>
<li>When the user connects to a POP server, copies of the messages are kept in the mail server for a short time, but IMAP keeps them for a long time.</li>
<li>IMAP sends and retrieves email, but POP only retrieves email.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> IMAP and POP are protocols that are used to retrieve email messages. The advantage of using IMAP instead of POP is that when the user connects to an IMAP-capable server, copies of the messages are downloaded to the client application. IMAP then stores the email messages on the server until the user manually deletes those messages.</p></div>
<p><strong>54. A technician can ping the IP address of the web server of a remote company but cannot successfully ping the URL address of the same web server. Which software utility can the technician use to diagnose the problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>tracert</li>
<li>ipconfig</li>
<li>netstat</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>nslookup</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Traceroute (tracert) is a utility that generates a list of hops that were successfully reached along the path from source to destination.This list can provide important verification and troubleshooting information. The ipconfig utility is used to display the IP configuration settings on a Windows PC. The Netstat utility is used to identify which active TCP connections are open and running on a networked host. Nslookup is a utility that allows the user to manually query the name servers to resolve a given host name. This utility can also be used to troubleshoot name resolution issues and to verify the current status of the name servers.</p></div>
<p><strong>55. Which two functions are performed at the LLC sublayer of the OSI Data Link Layer to facilitate Ethernet communication? (Choose two.)</strong></p>

</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data link layer is actually divided into two sublayers:</p>
<p>+ Logical Link Control (LLC): This upper sublayer defines the software processes that provide services to the network layer protocols. It places information in the frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being used for the frame. This information allows multiple Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6, to utilize the same network interface and media.<br />
+ Media Access Control (MAC): This lower sublayer defines the media access processes performed by the hardware. It provides data link layer addressing and delimiting of data according to the physical signaling requirements of the medium and the type of data link layer protocol in use.</p></div>
<p><strong>56. The global configuration command <em>ip default-gateway 172.16.100.1 </em>is applied to a switch. What is the effect of this command?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The switch can communicate with other hosts on the 172.16.100.0 network.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The switch can be remotely managed from a host on another network.</strong></span></li>
<li>The switch is limited to sending and receiving frames to and from the gateway 172.16.100.1.</li>
<li>The switch will have a management interface with the address 172.16.100.1.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A default gateway address is typically configured on all devices to allow them to communicate beyond just their local network.In a switch this is achieved using the command ip default-gateway &lt;ip address&gt;.</p></div>
<p><strong>57. What happens when the <em>transport input ssh </em>command is entered on the switch vty lines?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SSH client on the switch is enabled.</li>
<li>The switch requires a username/password combination for remote access.</li>

<p><strong>59. A disgruntled employee is using some free wireless networking tools to determine information about the enterprise wireless networks. This person is planning on using this information to hack the wireless network. What type of attack is this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DoS</li>
<li>access</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>reconnaissance</strong></span></li>
<li>Trojan horse</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A reconnaissance attack is the unauthorized discovery and documentation of various computing networks, network systems, resources, applications, services, or vulnerabilities.</p></div>
<p><strong>60. What service is provided by HTTP?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uses encryption to secure the exchange of text, graphic images, sound, and video on the web.</li>
<li>Allows for data transfers between a client and a file server.</li>
<li>An application that allows real-time chatting among remote users.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A basic set of rules for exchanging text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files on the web.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>61. A client packet is received by a server. The packet has a destination port number of 67. What service is the client requesting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FTP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DHCP</strong></span></li>
<li>Telnet</li>
<li>SSH</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>62. What are two problems that can be caused by a large number of ARP request and reply messages? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Switches become overloaded because they concentrate all the traffic from the attached subnets.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The ARP request is sent as a broadcast, and will flood the entire subnet.</strong></span></li>
<li>The network may become overloaded because ARP reply messages have a very large payload due to the 48-bit MAC address and 32-bit IP address that they contain.</li>
<li>A large number of ARP request and reply messages may slow down the switching process, leading the switch to make many changes in its MAC table.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>All ARP request messages must be processed by all nodes on the local network.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> ARP requests are sent as broadcasts:<br />
(1) All nodes will receive them, and they will be processed by software, interrupting the CPU.<br />
(2) The switch forwards (floods) Layer 2 broadcasts to all ports.</p>
<p>A switch does not change its MAC table based on ARP request or reply messages. The switch populates the MAC table using the source MAC address of all frames. The ARP payload is very small and does not overload the switch.</p></div>
<p><strong>63. A group of Windows PCs in a new subnet has been added to an Ethernet network. When testing the connectivity, a technician finds that these PCs can access local network resources but not the Internet resources. To troubleshoot the problem, the technician wants to initially confirm the IP address and DNS configurations on the PCs, and also verify connectivity to the local router. Which three Windows CLI commands and utilities will provide the necessary information? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>netsh interface ipv6 show neighbor</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>64. During the process of forwarding traffic, what will the router do immediately after matching the destination IP address to a network on a directly connected routing table entry?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>analyze the destination IP address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>switch the packet to the directly connected interface</strong></span></li>
<li>look up the next-hop address for the packet</li>
<li>discard the traffic after consulting the route table</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A router receives a packet on an interface and looks at the destination IP address. It consults its routing table and matches the destination IP address to a routing table entry. The router then discovers that it has to send the packet to the next-hop address or out to a directly connected interface. When the destination address is on a directly connected interface, the packet is switched over to that interface.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A cybersecurity specialist must be aware of the technologies and measures that are used as countermeasures to protect the organization from threats and vulnerabilities.</p></div>
<p><strong>68. Which type of security threat would be responsible if a spreadsheet add-on disables the local software firewall?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>brute-force attack</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Trojan horse</strong></span></li>
<li>DoS</li>
<li>buffer overflow</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A Trojan horse is software that does something harmful, but is hidden in legitimate software code. A denial of service (DoS) attack results in interruption of network services to users, network devices, or applications. A brute-force attack commonly involves trying to access a network device. A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to store more data in a memory location than it can hold.</p></div>

<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">coverage area</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The three areas of concern for wireless networks focus on the size of the coverage area, any nearby interference, and providing network security. Extensive cabling is not a concern for wireless networks, as a wireless network will require minimal cabling for providing wireless access to hosts. Mobility options are not a component of the areas of concern for wireless networks.</p></div>
<p><strong>81. A new network administrator has been asked to enter a banner message on a Cisco device. What is the fastest way a network administrator could test whether the banner is properly configured?</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>provides the formatting of data</li>
<li>provides end-to-end delivery of data between hosts</li>
<li>provides delivery of data between two applications</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>provides for the exchange of frames over a common local media</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>84. What is the purpose of the TCP sliding window?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to ensure that segments arrive in order at the destination</li>
<li>to end communication when data transmission is complete</li>
<li>to inform a source to retransmit data from a specific point forward</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to request that a source decrease the rate at which it transmits data</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The TCP sliding window allows a destination device to inform a source to slow down the rate of transmission. To do this, the destination device reduces the value contained in the window field of the segment. It is acknowledgment numbers that are used to specify retransmission from a specific point forward. It is sequence numbers that are used to ensure segments arrive in order. Finally, it is a FIN control bit that is used to end a communication session.</p></div>
<p><strong>85. What characteristic describes spyware?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a network device that filters access and traffic coming into a network</li>

<ul>
<li>FEC0::/10</li>
<li>FDEE::/7</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>FE80::/10</strong></span></li>
<li>FF00::/8</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Link-local addresses are in the range of FE80::/10 to FEBF::/10. The original IPv6 specification defined site-local addresses and used the prefix range FEC0::/10, but these addresses were deprecated by the IETF in favor of unique local addresses. FDEE::/7 is a unique local address because it is in the range of FC00::/7 to FDFF::/7. IPv6 multicast addresses have the prefix FF00::/8.</p></div>
<p><strong>88. What service is provided by FTP?</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>90. Which two statements accurately describe an advantage or a disadvantage when deploying NAT for IPv4 in a network? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NAT adds authentication capability to IPv4.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NAT introduces problems for some applications that require end-to-end connectivity.</strong></span></li>
<li>NAT will impact negatively on switch performance.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NAT provides a solution to slow down the IPv4 address depletion.</strong></span></li>
<li>NAT improves packet handling.</li>
<li>NAT causes routing tables to include more information.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology that is implemented within IPv4 networks. One application of NAT is to use private IP addresses inside a network and use NAT to share a few public IP addresses for many internal hosts. In this way it provides a solution to slow down the IPv4 address depletion. However, since NAT hides the actual IP addresses that are used by end devices, it may cause problems for some applications that require end-to-end connectivity.</p></div>
<p><strong>91. What would be the interface ID of an IPv6 enabled interface with a MAC address of 1C-6F-65-C2-BD-F8 when the interface ID is generated by using the EUI-64 process?</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>C16F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8</li>
<li>106F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To derive the EUI-64 interface ID by using the MAC address 1C-6F-65-C2-BD-F8, three steps are taken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the seventh bit of the MAC address from a binary 0 to a binary 1 which changes the hex C, into a hex E.</li>
<li>Insert hex digits FFFE into the middle of the address.</li>
<li>Rewrite the address in IPv6 format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three steps, when complete, give the interface ID of <strong>1E6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8</strong>.</p></div>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Time-to-Live field from IPv4 has been replaced by the Hop Limit field in IPv6.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The IPv6 packet header fields are as follows: Version, Traffic Class, Flow Label, Payload Length, Next Header, Hop Limit, Source Address, and Destination Address. The IPv4 packet header fields include the following: Version, Differentiated Services, Time-to-Live, Protocol, Source IP Address, and Destination IP Address. Both versions have a 4-bit Version field. Both versions have a Source (IP) Address field. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits; IPv6 addresses are 128 bits. The Time-to-Live or TTL field in IPv4 is now called Hop Limit in IPv6, but this field serves the same purpose in both versions. The value in this 8-bit field decrements each time a packet passes through any router. When this value is 0, the packet is discarded and is not forwarded to any other router.</p></div>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>use of checksum</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Both TCP and UDP use source and destination port numbers to distinguish different data streams and to forward the right data segments to the right applications. Error checking the header and data is done by both protocols by using a checksum calculation to determine the integrity of the data that is received. TCP is connection-oriented and uses a 3-way handshake to establish an initial connection. TCP also uses window to regulate the amount of traffic sent before receiving an acknowledgment. UDP is connectionless and is the best protocol for carry digitized VoIP signals.</p></div>

<li>only hosts A, B, and C</li>
<li>only router R1</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Because host A does not have the MAC address of the default gateway in the ARP table, host A sends an ARP broadcast. The ARP broadcast would be sent to every device on the local network. Hosts B, C, and router R1 would receive the broadcast. Router R1 would not forward the message.</p></div>
<p><strong>128. Which wireless technology has low-power and low-data rate requirements making it popular in IoT environments?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zigbee</strong></span></li>
<li>WiMAX</li>
<li>Wi-Fi</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Zigbee is a specification used for low-data rate, low-power communications. It is intended for applications that require short-range, low data-rates and long battery life. Zigbee is typically used for industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) environments such as wireless light switches and medical device data collection.</p></div>
<p><strong>129. What two ICMPv6 message types must be permitted through IPv6 access control lists to allow resolution of Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 MAC addresses? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>neighbor solicitations</strong></span></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>130. A client is using SLAAC to obtain an IPv6 address for its interface. After an address has been generated and applied to the interface, what must the client do before it can begin to use this IPv6 address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It must send a DHCPv6 INFORMATION-REQUEST message to request the address of the DNS server.</li>
<li>It must send a DHCPv6 REQUEST message to the DHCPv6 server to request permission to use this address.</li>
<li>It must send an ICMPv6 Router Solicitation message to determine what default gateway it should use.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It must send an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation message to ensure that the address is not already in use on the network.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>131. Two pings were issued from a host on a local network. The first ping was issued to the IP address of the default gateway of the host and it failed. The second ping was issued to the IP address of a host outside the local network and it was successful. What is a possible cause for the failed ping?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The default gateway is not operational.</li>
<li>The default gateway device is configured with the wrong IP address.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Security rules are applied to the default gateway device, preventing it from processing ping requests.</strong></span></li>
<li>The TCP/IP stack on the default gateway is not working properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>132. An organization is assigned an IPv6 address block of 2001:db8:0:ca00::/56. How many subnets can be created without using bits in the interface ID space?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>256</strong></span></li>
<li>512</li>
<li>1024</li>
<li>4096</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>133. What subnet mask is needed if an IPv4 network has 40 devices that need IP addresses and address space is not to be wasted?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>255.255.255.0</li>
<li>255.255.255.240</li>
<li>255.255.255.128</li>

<li>255.255.255.224</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> In order to accommodate 40 devices, 6 host bits are needed. With 6 bits, 64 addresses are possible, but one address is for the subnet number and one address is for a broadcast. This leaves 62 addresses that can be assigned to network devices. The mask associated with leaving 6 host bits for addressing is 255.255.255.192.</p></div>
<p><strong>134. Refer to the exhibit. If host A sends an IP packet to host B, what will the destination address be in the frame when it leaves host A?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41167" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/i274590v1n1_274590.png" alt="" width="584" height="294" /></p>

<li>AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a host sends information to a distant network, the Layer 2 frame header will contain a source and destination MAC address. The source address will be the originating host device. The destination address will be the router interface that connects to the same network. In the case of host A sending information to host B, the source address is AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA and the destination address is the MAC address assigned to the R2 Ethernet interface, BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB.</p></div>
<p><strong>135. What is a benefit of using cloud computing in networking?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Technology is integrated into every-day appliances allowing them to interconnect with other devices, making them more ‘smart’ or automated.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Network capabilities are extended without requiring investment in new infrastructure, personnel, or software.</strong></span></li>
<li>End users have the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business network.</li>
<li>Home networking uses existing electrical wiring to connect devices to the network wherever there is an electrical outlet, saving the cost of installing data cables.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cloud computing extends IT’s capabilities without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. These services are available on-demand and delivered economically to any device anywhere in the world without compromising security or function. BYOD is about end users having the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business or campus network. Smart home technology is integrated into every-day appliances allowing them to interconnect with other devices, making them more ‘smart’ or automated. Powerline networking is a trend for home networking that uses existing electrical wiring to connect devices to the network wherever there is an electrical outlet, saving the cost of installing data cables.</p></div>
<p><strong>136. Which two statements are correct about MAC and IP addresses during data transmission if NAT is not involved? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Destination IP addresses in a packet header remain constant along the entire path to a target host.</strong></span></li>
<li>Destination MAC addresses will never change in a frame that goes across seven routers.</li>
<li>Every time a frame is encapsulated with a new destination MAC address, a new destination IP address is needed.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Destination and source MAC addresses have local significance and change every time a frame goes from one LAN to another.</strong></span></li>
<li>A packet that has crossed four routers has changed the destination IP address four times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>137. What is one main characteristic of the data link layer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It generates the electrical or optical signals that represent the 1 and 0 on the media.</li>
<li>It converts a stream of data bits into a predefined code.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It shields the upper layer protocol from being aware of the physical medium to be used in the communication.</strong></span></li>
<li>It accepts Layer 3 packets and decides the path by which to forward the packet to a remote network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>138. What are three characteristics of the CSMA/CD process? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The device with the electronic token is the only one that can transmit after a collision.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A device listens and waits until the media is not busy before transmitting.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>After detecting a collision, hosts can attempt to resume transmission after a random time delay has expired.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>All of the devices on a segment see data that passes on the network medium.</strong></span></li>
<li>A jam signal indicates that the collision has cleared and the media is not busy.</li>
<li>Devices can be configured with a higher transmission priority.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) process is a contention-based media access control mechanism used on shared media access networks, such as Ethernet. When a device needs to transmit data, it listens and waits until the media is available (quiet), then it will send data. If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision will occur. Both devices will detect the collision on the network. When a device detects a collision, it will stop the data transmission process, wait for a random amount of time, then try again.</p></div>
<p><strong>139. Which information does the show startup-config command display?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the IOS image copied into RAM</li>
<li>the bootstrap program in the ROM</li>
<li>the contents of the current running configuration file in the RAM</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the contents of the saved configuration file in the NVRAM</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The show startup-config command displays the saved configuration located in NVRAM. The show running-config command displays the contents of the currently running configuration file located in RAM.​<br />
</p></div>
<p><strong>140. Which two commands can be used on a Windows host to display the routing table? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>netstat -s</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>route print</strong></span></li>
<li>show ip route</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>netstat -r</strong></span></li>
<li>tracert</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
On a Windows host, the route print or netstat -r commands can be used to display the host routing table. Both commands generate the same output. On a router, the show ip route command is used to display the routing table. The netstat –s command is used to display per-protocol statistics. The tracert command is used to display the path that a packet travels to its destination.</p></div>
<p><strong>141. What are two functions that are provided by the network layer? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>directing data packets to destination hosts on other networks</strong></span></li>
<li>placing data on the network medium</li>
<li>carrying data between processes that are running on source and destination hosts</li>
<li>providing dedicated end-to-end connections</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>providing end devices with a unique network identifier</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The network layer is primarily concerned with passing data from a source to a destination on another network. IP addresses supply unique identifiers for the source and destination. The network layer provides connectionless, best-effort delivery. Devices rely on higher layers to supply services to processes.</p></div>
<p><strong>142. Which two statements describe features of an IPv4 routing table on a router? (Choose two.)​</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directly connected interfaces will have two route source codes in the routing table: C and S .</li>
<li>If there are two or more possible routes to the same destination, the route associated with the higher metric value is included in the routing table.</li>
<li>The netstat -r command can be used to display the routing table of a router.​</li>
<li>The routing table lists the MAC addresses of each active interface.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It stores information about routes derived from the active router interfaces.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If a default static route is configured in the router, an entry will be included in the routing table with source code S .</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The <b>show ip route</b> command is used to display the routing table of the router. In IPv4, directly connected interfaces will have one source code:<b>C</b>. The routing table stores information about directly connected routes and remote routes. An entry in the routing table with a source code of <b>S</b> is included if a default static route is configured on the router.</p></div>
<p><strong>143. What characteristic describes a VPN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>software on a router that filters traffic based on IP addresses or applications</li>
<li>software that identifies fast-spreading threats</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>a tunneling protocol that provides remote users with secure access into the network of an organization</strong></span></li>
<li>a network device that filters access and traffic coming into a network</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>144. Why would a Layer 2 switch need an IP address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to enable the switch to send broadcast frames to attached PCs</li>
<li>to enable the switch to function as a default gateway</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">to enable the switch to be managed remotely</span></strong></li>
<li>to enable the switch to receive frames from attached PCs</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A switch, as a Layer 2 device, does not need an IP address to transmit frames to attached devices. However, when a switch is accessed remotely through the network, it must have a Layer 3 address. The IP address must be applied to a virtual interface rather than to a physical interface. Routers, not switches, function as default gateways.</p></div>
<p><strong>145. Match each description to its corresponding term. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41320" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/17.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="665" /></p>
<p><strong>146. A user sends an HTTP request to a web server on a remote network. During encapsulation for this request, what information is added to the address field of a frame to indicate the destination?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the network domain of the destination host</li>
<li>the IP address of the default gateway</li>
<li>the MAC address of the destination host</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the MAC address of the default gateway</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A frame is encapsulated with source and destination MAC addresses. The source device will not know the MAC address of the remote host. An ARP request will be sent by the source and will be responded to by the router. The router will respond with the MAC address of its interface, the one which is connected to the same network as the source.</p></div>
<p><strong>147. What is an advantage to using a protocol that is defined by an open standard?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A company can monopolize the market.</li>
<li>The protocol can only be run on equipment from a specific vendor.</li>
<li>An open standard protocol is not controlled or regulated by standards organizations.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It encourages competition and promotes choices.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A monopoly by one company is not a good idea from a user point of view. If a protocol can only be run on one brand, it makes it difficult to have mixed equipment in a network. A proprietary protocol is not free to use. An open standard protocol will in general be implemented by a wide range of vendors.</p></div>
<p><strong>148. Data is being sent from a source PC to a destination server. Which three statements correctly describe the function of TCP or UDP in this situation? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The source port field identifies the running application or service that will handle data returning to the PC.</span></strong></li>
<li>The TCP process running on the PC randomly selects the destination port when establishing a session with the server.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">UDP segments are encapsulated within IP packets for transport across the network.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The UDP destination port number identifies the application or service on the server which will handle the data.</span></strong></li>
<li>TCP is the preferred protocol when a function requires lower network overhead.</li>
<li>The TCP source port number identifies the sending host on the network.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Layer 4 port numbers identify the application or service which will handle the data. The source port number is added by the sending device and will be the destination port number when the requested information is returned. Layer 4 segments are encapsulated within IP packets. UDP, not TCP, is used when low overhead is needed. A source IP address, not a TCP source port number, identifies the sending host on the network. Destination port numbers are specific ports that a server application or service monitors for requests.</p></div>
<p><strong>149. Match each description with the corresponding TCP mechanism. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />

<p><strong>150. Refer to the exhibit. A company uses the address block of 128.107.0.0/16 for its network. What subnet mask would provide the maximum number of equal size subnets while providing enough host addresses for each subnet in the exhibit?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41169" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/i207609v1n1_207609.png" alt="" width="571" height="419" /></p>

<li>255.255.255.240</li>
<li>255.255.255.224</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The largest subnet in the topology has 100 hosts in it so the subnet mask must have at least 7 host bits in it (27-2=126). 255.255.255.0 has 8 hosts bits, but this does not meet the requirement of providing the maximum number of subnets.</p></div>
<p><strong>151. A network administrator wants to have the same subnet mask for three subnetworks at a small site. The site has the following networks and numbers of devices:</strong></p>
<pre>Subnetwork A: IP phones – 10 addresses

Subnetwork B: PCs – 8 addresses

Subnetwork C: Printers – 2 addresses</pre>
<p><strong>What single subnet mask would be appropriate to use for the three subnetworks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>255.255.255.0</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>255.255.255.240</strong></span></li>
<li>255.255.255.248</li>
<li>255.255.255.252</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
If the same mask is to be used, then the network with the most hosts must be examined for number of hosts. Because this is 10 hosts, 4 host bits are needed. The /28 or 255.255.255.240 subnet mask would be appropriate to use for these networks. ​</p></div>
<p><strong>152. Match each item to the type of topology diagram on which it is typically identified. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />

<p><strong>153. What two pieces of information are displayed in the output of the show ip interface brief command? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">IP addresses</span></strong></li>
<li>interface descriptions</li>
<li>MAC addresses</li>
<li>next-hop addresses</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Layer 1 statuses</span></strong></li>
<li>speed and duplex settings</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The command show ip interface brief shows the IP address of each interface, as well as the operational status of the interfaces at both Layer 1 and Layer 2. In order to see interface descriptions and speed and duplex settings, use the command show running-config interface. Next-hop addresses are displayed in the routing table with the command show ip route, and the MAC address of an interface can be seen with the command show interfaces.</p></div>
<p><strong>154. A user is complaining that an external web page is taking longer than normal to load.The web page does eventually load on the user machine. Which tool should the technician use with administrator privileges in order to locate where the issue is in the network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ping</li>
<li>nslookup</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">tracert</span></strong></li>
<li>ipconfig /displaydns</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The Command Prompt command tracert will map the path from the PC to the web server and measure transit delays of packets across the network.</p></div>
<p><strong>155. Which value, that is contained in an IPv4 header field, is decremented by each router that receives a packet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Header Length</li>
<li>Differentiated Services</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Time-to-Live</strong></span></li>
<li>Fragment Offset</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a router receives a packet, the router will decrement the Time-to-Live (TTL) field by one. When the field reaches zero, the receiving router will discard the packet and will send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the sender.</p></div>
<p><strong>156. A network technician is researching the use of fiber optic cabling in a new technology center. Which two issues should be considered before implementing fiber optic media? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiber optic cabling requires different termination and splicing expertise from what copper cabling requires.</span></strong></li>
<li>Fiber optic cabling requires specific grounding to be immune to EMI.</li>
<li>Fiber optic cabling is susceptible to loss of signal due to RFI.</li>
