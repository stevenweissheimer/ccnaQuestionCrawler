<ul>
<li>The default gateway address is not provided in the pool.</li>
<li>No clients have communicated with the DHCPv6 server yet.</li>
<li>The IPv6 DHCP pool configuration has no IPv6 address range specified.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>The state is not maintained by the DHCPv6 server under stateless DHCPv6 operation.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Under the stateless DHCPv6 configuration, indicated by the command ipv6 nd other-config-flag, the DHCPv6 server does not maintain the state information, because client IPv6 addresses are not managed by the DHCP server. Because the clients will configure their IPv6 addresses by combining the prefix/prefix-length and a self-generated interface ID, the ipv6 dhcp pool configuration does not need to specify the valid IPv6 address range. And because clients will use the link-local address of the router interface as the default gateway address, the default gateway address is not necessary.</p></div>

<p><strong>11. Which statement is correct about how a Layer 2 switch determines how to forward frames?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Frame forwarding decisions are based on MAC address and port mappings in the CAM table.</span></strong></li>
<li>Only frames with a broadcast destination address are forwarded out all active switch ports.</li>
<li>Unicast frames are always forwarded regardless of the destination MAC address.</li>
<li>Cut-through frame forwarding ensures that invalid frames are always dropped.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cut-through frame forwarding reads up to only the first 22 bytes of a frame, which excludes the frame check sequence and thus invalid frames may be forwarded. In addition to broadcast frames, frames with a destination MAC address that is not in the CAM are also flooded out all active ports. Unicast frames are not always forwarded. Received frames with a destination MAC address that is associated with the switch port on which it is received are not forwarded because the destination exists on the network segment connected to that port.</p></div>
<p><strong>12. Which statement describes a result after multiple Cisco LAN switches are interconnected?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The broadcast domain expands to all switches.</span></strong></li>
<li>One collision domain exists per switch.</li>
<li>There is one broadcast domain and one collision domain per switch.</li>
<li>Frame collisions increase on the segments connecting the switches.</li>
<li>Unicast frames are always forwarded regardless of the destination MAC address.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Cisco LAN switches, the microsegmentation makes it possible for each port to represent a separate segment and thus each switch port represents a separate collision domain. This fact will not change when multiple switches are interconnected. However, LAN switches do not filter broadcast frames. A broadcast frame is flooded to all ports. Interconnected switches form one big broadcast domain.</p></div>
<p><strong>13. Match the link state to the interface and protocol status. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45475" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-13.png" alt="" width="734" height="569" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-13.png 734w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-13-300x233.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /></p>
<p><strong>14.Refer to the exhibit. How is a frame sent from PCA forwarded to PCC if the MAC address table on switch SW1 is empty?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45476" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-31_202702.png" alt="" width="614" height="356" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-31_202702.png 614w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-31_202702-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>SW1 forwards the frame directly to SW2. SW2 floods the frame to all ports connected to SW2, excluding the port through which the frame entered the switch.</li>
<li>SW1 floods the frame on all ports on the switch, excluding the interconnected port to switch SW2 and the port through which the frame entered the switch.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SW1 floods the frame on all ports on SW1, excluding the port through which the frame entered the switch.</span></strong></li>
<li>SW1 drops the frame because it does not know the destination MAC address.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a switch powers on, the MAC address table is empty. The switch builds the MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of incoming frames. The switch forwards based on the destination MAC address found in the frame header. If a switch has no entries in the MAC address table or if the destination MAC address is not in the switch table, the switch will forward the frame out all ports except the port that brought the frame into the switch.</p></div>
<p><strong>15. An administrator is trying to remove configurations from a switch. After using the command erase startup-config and reloading the switch, the administrator finds that VLANs 10 and 100 still exist on the switch. Why were these VLANs not removed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Because these VLANs are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory, this file must be manually deleted.</strong></span></li>
<li>These VLANs cannot be deleted unless the switch is in VTP client mode.</li>
<li>These VLANs are default VLANs that cannot be removed.</li>
<li>These VLANs can only be removed from the switch by using the no vlan 10 and no vlan 100 commands.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Standard range VLANs (1-1005) are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory. Erasing the startup configuration and reloading a switch does not automatically remove these VLANs. The vlan.dat file must be manually deleted from flash memory and then the switch must be reloaded.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. Match the description to the correct VLAN type. (Not all options are used.)</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45477" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-16.png" alt="" width="730" height="692" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-16.png 730w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCNA-2-v7-final-exam-answers-16-300x284.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A data VLAN is configured to carry user-generated traffic. A default VLAN is the VLAN where all switch ports belong after the initial boot up of a switch loading the default configuration. A native VLAN is assigned to an 802.1Q trunk port, and untagged traffic is placed on it. A management VLAN is any VLAN that is configured to access the management capabilities of a switch. An IP address and subnet mask are assigned to it, allowing the switch to be managed via HTTP, Telnet, SSH, or SNMP.</p></div>
<p><strong>17. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator has connected two switches together using EtherChannel technology. If STP is running, what will be the end result?</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45478" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Switching-Routing-and-Wireless-Essentials-Version-7.00-Final-Answers-9.png" alt="" width="752" height="246" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Switching-Routing-and-Wireless-Essentials-Version-7.00-Final-Answers-9.png 752w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Switching-Routing-and-Wireless-Essentials-Version-7.00-Final-Answers-9-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">STP will block one of the redundant links.</span></strong></li>
<li>The switches will load balance and utilize both EtherChannels to forward packets.</li>
<li>The resulting loop will create a broadcast storm.</li>
<li>Both port channels will shutdown.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cisco switches support two protocols for negotiating a channel between two switches: LACP and PAgP. PAgP is Cisco-proprietary. In the topology shown, the switches are connected to each other using redundant links. By default, STP is enabled on switch devices. STP will block redundant links to prevent loops.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>because VLAN 99 is not a valid management VLAN</li>
<li>because there is a cabling problem on VLAN 99</li>
<li>because VLAN 1 is up and there can only be one management VLAN on the switch</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">because VLAN 99 has not yet been created</span></strong></li>

<p><strong>27. Which three steps should be taken before moving a Cisco switch to a new VTP management domain? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Configure the switch with the name of the new management domain.</span></strong></li>
<li>Reset the VTP counters to allow the switch to synchronize with the other switches in the domain.</li>
<li>Configure the VTP server in the domain to recognize the BID of the new switch.</li>

<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reboot the switch.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When adding a new switch to a VTP domain, it is critical to configure the switch with a new domain name, the correct VTP mode, VTP version number, and password. A switch with a higher revision number can propagate invalid VLANs and erase valid VLANs thus preventing connectivity for multiple devices on the valid VLANs.</p></div>
<p><strong>28. A network administrator is preparing the implementation of Rapid PVST+ on a production network. How are the Rapid PVST+ link types determined on the switch interfaces?</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>30. How will a router handle static routing differently if Cisco Express Forwarding is disabled?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will not perform recursive lookups.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethernet multiaccess interfaces will require fully specified static routes to avoid routing inconsistencies.</span></strong></li>
<li>Static routes that use an exit interface will be unnecessary.</li>
<li>Serial point-to-point interfaces will require fully specified static routes to avoid routing inconsistencies.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> In most platforms running IOS 12.0 or later, Cisco Express Forwarding is enabled by default. Cisco Express Forwarding eliminates the need for the recursive lookup. If Cisco Express Forwarding is disabled, multiaccess network interfaces require fully specified static routes in order to avoid inconsistencies in their routing tables. Point-to-point interfaces do not have this problem, because multiple end points are not present. With or without Cisco Express Forwarding enabled, using an exit interface when configuring a static route is a viable option.</p></div>
<p><strong>31. Compared with dynamic routes, what are two advantages of using static routes on a router? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They improve netw​ork security.</span></strong></li>
<li>They take less time to converge when the network topology changes.</li>
<li>They improve the efficiency of discovering neighboring networks.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They use fewer router resources.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Static routes are manually configured on a router. Static routes are not automatically updated and must be manually reconfigured if the network topology changes. Thus static routing improves network security because it does not make route updates among neighboring routers. Static routes also improve resource efficiency by using less bandwidth, and no CPU cycles are used to calculate and communicate routes.</p></div>
<p><strong>32. Refer to the exhibit. Which route was configured as a static route to a specific network using the next-hop address?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45483" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rx6.png" alt="" width="522" height="221" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rx6.png 522w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rx6-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S 10.17.2.0/24 [1/0] via 10.16.2.2</span></strong></li>

<li>S 10.17.2.0/24 is directly connected, Serial 0/0/0</li>
<li>C 10.16.2.0/24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The C in a routing table indicates an interface that is up and has an IP address assigned. The S in a routing table signifies that a route was installed using the ip route command. Two of the routing table entries shown are static routes to a specific destination (the 192.168.2.0 network). The entry that has the S denoting a static route and [1/0] was configured using the next-hop address. The other entry (S 192.168.2.0/24 is directly connected, Serial 0/0/0) is a static route configured using the exit interface. The entry with the 0.0.0.0 route is a default static route which is used to send packets to any destination network that is not specifically listed in the routing table.</p></div>
<p><strong>33. What is the effect of entering the spanning-tree portfast configuration command on a switch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It disables an unused port.</li>
<li>It disables all trunk ports.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It enables portfast on a specific switch interface.</span></strong></li>
<li>It checks the source L2 address in the Ethernet header against the sender L2 address in the ARP body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>34. What is the IPv6 prefix that is used for link-local addresses?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FF01::/8</li>
<li>2001::/3</li>
<li>FC00::/7</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">FE80::/10</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The IPv6 link-local prefix is FE80::/10 and is used to create a link-local IPv6 address on an interface.</p></div>
<p><strong>35. Which two statements are characteristics of routed ports on a multilayer switch? (Choose two.)​</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In a switched network, they are mostly configured between switches at the core and distribution layers.</span></strong></li>
<li>The interface vlan command has to be entered to create a VLAN on routed ports.</li>
<li>They support subinterfaces, like interfaces on the Cisco IOS routers.</li>
<li>They are used for point-to-multipoint links.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They are not associated with a particular VLAN.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>36. Successful inter-VLAN routing has been operating on a network with multiple VLANs across multiple switches for some time. When an inter-switch trunk link fails and Spanning Tree Protocol brings up a backup trunk link, it is reported that hosts on two VLANs can access some, but not all the network resources that could be accessed previously. Hosts on all other VLANS do not have this problem. What is the most likely cause of this problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The protected edge port function on the backup trunk interfaces has been disabled.</span></strong></li>
<li>The allowed VLANs on the backup link were not configured correctly.</li>
<li>Dynamic Trunking Protocol on the link has failed.</li>
<li>Inter-VLAN routing also failed when the trunk link failed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>37. Which command will start the process to bundle two physical interfaces to create an EtherChannel group via LACP?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>interface port-channel 2</li>
<li>channel-group 1 mode desirable</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">interface range GigabitEthernet 0/4 &#8211; 5</span></strong></li>
<li>channel-group 2 mode auto</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>38. What action takes place when a frame entering a switch has a multicast destination MAC address?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The switch will forward the frame out all ports except the incoming port.</span></strong></li>
<li>The switch forwards the frame out of the specified port.</li>
<li>The switch adds a MAC address table entry mapping for the destination MAC address and the ingress port.</li>
<li>The switch replaces the old entry and uses the more current port.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> If the destination MAC address is a broadcast or a multicast, the frame is also flooded out all ports except the incoming port.</p></div>
<p><strong>39. A junior technician was adding a route to a LAN router. A traceroute to a device on the new network revealed a wrong path and unreachable status. What should be done or checked?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that there is not a default route in any of the edge router routing tables.</li>
<li>Check the configuration on the floating static route and adjust the AD.</li>
<li>Create a floating static route to that network.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Check the configuration of the exit interface on the new static route.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>40. Select the three PAgP channel establishment modes. (Choose three.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>41. A static route has been configured on a router. However, the destination network no longer exists. What should an administrator do to remove the static route from the routing table?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Remove the route using the no ip route command.</span></strong></li>
<li>Change the administrative distance for that route.</li>
<li>Change the routing metric for that route.</li>
<li>Nothing. The static route will go away on its own.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When the destination network specified in a static route does not exist anymore, the static route stays in the routing table until it is manually removed by using the <strong>no ip route</strong> command.</p></div>

PortFast – used to immediately bring an interface configured as an access or trunk port to the forwarding state from a blocking state. Applied to all end-user ports.<br />
BPDU guard – immediately error-disables a port that receives a BPDU. Applied to all end-user ports.The receipt of BPDUs may be part of an unauthorized attempt to add a switch to the network.<br />
Root guard – prevents a switch from becoming the root switch. Applied to all ports where the root switch should not be located.<br />
Loop guard – detects unidirectional links to prevent alternate or root ports from becoming designated ports. Applied to all ports that are or can become nondesignated.</p></div><br />
<strong>52. Why is DHCP snooping required when using the Dynamic ARP Inspection feature?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It relies on the settings of trusted and untrusted ports set by DHCP snooping.</li>
<li>It uses the MAC address table to verify the default gateway IP address.</li>
<li>It redirects ARP requests to the DHCP server for verification.</li>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong> DAI relies on DHCP snooping. DHCP snooping listens to DHCP message exchanges and builds a bindings database of valid tuples (MAC address, IP address, VLAN interface).</p>
<p>When DAI is enabled, the switch drops ARP packet if the sender MAC address and sender IP address do not match an entry in the DHCP snooping bindings database. However, it can be overcome through static mappings. Static mappings are useful when hosts configure static IP addresses, DHCP snooping cannot be run, or other switches in the network do not run dynamic ARP inspection. A static mapping associates an IP address to a MAC address on a VLAN.</p></div>

<li>It disables DTP on a non-trunking interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>69. What would be the primary reason an attacker would launch a MAC address overflow attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>so that the switch stops forwarding traffic</li>
<li>so that legitimate hosts cannot obtain a MAC address</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>so that the attacker can see frames that are destined for other hosts</strong></span></li>

<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>RADIUS</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Server-based AAA authentication uses an external TACACS or RADIUS authentication server to maintain a username and password database. When a client establishes a connection with an AAA enabled device, the device authenticates the client by querying the authentication servers.</p></div>
<p><strong>77. A network administrator is configuring a WLAN. Why would the administrator disable the broadcast feature for the SSID?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>to eliminate outsiders scanning for available SSIDs in the area</strong></span></li>
<li>to reduce the risk of interference by external devices such as microwave ovens</li>
<li>to reduce the risk of unauthorized APs being added to the network</li>
<li>to provide privacy and integrity to wireless traffic by using encryption</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>78. Which mitigation technique would prevent rogue servers from providing false IP configuration parameters to clients?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>implementing port security</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">turning on DHCP snooping</span></strong></li>
<li>disabling CDP on edge ports</li>
<li>implementing port-security on edge ports</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Like Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), IP Source Guard (IPSG) needs to determine the validity of MAC-address-to-IP-address bindings. To do this IPSG uses the bindings database built by DHCP snooping.</p></div>
<p><strong>79. A network administrator configures the port security feature on a switch. The security policy specifies that each access port should allow up to two MAC addresses. When the maximum number of MAC addresses is reached, a frame with the unknown source MAC address is dropped and a notification is sent to the syslog server. Which security violation mode should be configured for each access port?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>shutdown</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">restrict</span></strong></li>
<li>warning</li>
<li>protect</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In port security implementation, an interface can be configured for one of three violation modes:<br />
<strong>Protect</strong> – a port security violation causes the interface to drop packets with unknown source addresses and no notification is sent that a security violation has occurred.<br />
<strong>Restrict</strong> – a port security violation causes the interface to drop packets with unknown source addresses and to send a notification that a security violation has occurred.<br />
<strong>Shutdown</strong> – a port security violation causes the interface to immediately become error-disabled and turns off the port LED. No notification is sent that a security violation has occurred.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A backup static route is called a floating static route. A floating static route has an administrative distance greater than the administrative distance of another static route or dynamic route.</p></div>
<p><strong>88. What mitigation plan is best for thwarting a DoS attack that is creating a MAC address table overflow?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disable DTP.</li>
<li>Disable STP.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Enable port security.</strong></span></li>
<li>Place unused ports in an unused VLAN.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A MAC address (CAM) table overflow attack, buffer overflow, and MAC address spoofing can all be mitigated by configuring port security. A network administrator would typically not want to disable STP because it prevents Layer 2 loops. DTP is disabled to prevent VLAN hopping. Placing unused ports in an unused VLAN prevents unauthorized wired connectivity.</p></div>
<p><strong>89. A network engineer is troubleshooting a newly deployed wireless network that is using the latest 802.11 standards. When users access high bandwidth services such as streaming video, the wireless network performance is poor. To improve performance the network engineer decides to configure a 5 Ghz frequency band SSID and train users to use that SSID for streaming media services. Why might this solution improve the wireless network performance for that type of service?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring the users to switch to the 5 GHz band for streaming media is inconvenient and will result in fewer users accessing these services.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The 5 GHz band has more channels and is less crowded than the 2.4 GHz band, which makes it more suited to streaming multimedia.</span></strong></li>
<li>The 5 GHz band has a greater range and is therefore likely to be interference-free.</li>
<li>The only users that can switch to the 5 GHz band will be those with the latest wireless NICs, which will reduce usage.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Wireless range is determined by the access point antenna and output power, not the frequency band that is used. In this scenario it is stated that all users have wireless NICs that comply with the latest standard, and so all can access the 5 GHz band. Although some users may find it inconvenient to switch to the 5 Ghz band to access streaming services, it is the greater number of channels, not just fewer users, that will improve network performance.</p></div>
<p><strong>90. Which DHCPv4 message will a client send to accept an IPv4 address that is offered by a DHCP server?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>broadcast DHCPACK</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">broadcast DHCPREQUEST</span></strong></li>
<li>unicast DHCPACK</li>
<li>unicast DHCPREQUEST</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a DHCP client receives DHCPOFFER messages, it will send a broadcast DHCPREQUEST message for two purposes. First, it indicates to the offering DHCP server that it would like to accept the offer and bind the IP address. Second, it notifies any other responding DHCP servers that their offers are declined.</p></div>
<p><strong>91. Refer to the exhibit. Which destination MAC address is used when frames are sent from the workstation to the default gateway?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-37859" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i223091v1n1_223091.png" alt="" width="563" height="390" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i223091v1n1_223091.png 577w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/i223091v1n1_223091-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MAC address of the virtual router</span></strong></li>
<li>MAC address of the standby router</li>
<li>MAC addresses of both the forwarding and standby routers</li>
<li>MAC address of the forwarding router</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The IP address of the virtual router acts as the default gateway for all the workstations. Therefore, the MAC address that is returned by the Address Resolution Protocol to the workstation will be the MAC address of the virtual router.</p></div>
<p><strong>92. After a host has generated an IPv6 address by using the DHCPv6 or SLAAC process, how does the host verify that the address is unique and therefore usable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The host sends an ICMPv6 echo request message to the DHCPv6 or SLAAC-learned address and if no reply is returned, the address is considered unique.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The host sends an ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation message to the DHCP or SLAAC-learned address and if no neighbor advertisement is returned, the address is considered unique.</span></strong></li>
<li>The host checks the local neighbor cache for the learned address and if the address is not cached, it it considered unique.</li>
<li>The host sends an ARP broadcast to the local link and if no hosts send a reply, the address is considered unique.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Before a host can actually configure and use an IPv6 address learned through SLAAC or DHCP, the host must verify that no other host is already using that address. To verify that the address is indeed unique, the host sends an ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation to the address. If no neighbor advertisement is returned, the host considers the address to be unique and configures it on the interface.</p></div>
<p><strong>93. Match the purpose with its DHCP message type. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />

<p><strong>94. Which protocol adds security to remote connections?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FTP</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li>NetBEUI</li>
<li>POP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SSH</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> SSH allows a technician to securely connect to a remote network device for monitoring and troubleshooting. HTTP establishes web page requests. FTP manages file transfer. NetBEUI is not routed on the Internet. POP downloads email messages from email servers.</p></div>

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Place the options in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>a client initiating a message to find a DHCP server &#8211; DHCPDISCOVER</li>
<li>a DHCP server responding to the initial request by a client &#8211; DHCPOFFER</li>
<li>the client accepting the IP address provided by the DHCP server &#8211; DHCPREQUEST</li>
<li>the DHCP server confirming that the lease has been accepted &#8211; DHCPACK</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>98. What network attack seeks to create a DoS for clients by preventing them from being able to obtain a DHCP lease?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IP address spoofing</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">DHCP starvation</span></strong></li>
<li>CAM table attack</li>
<li>DHCP spoofing</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>DCHP starvation attacks are launched by an attacker with the intent to create a DoS for DHCP clients. To accomplish this goal, the attacker uses a tool that sends many DHCPDISCOVER messages in order to lease the entire pool of available IP addresses, thus denying them to legitimate hosts.</p></div>
<p><strong>99. Refer to the exhibit. If the IP addresses of the default gateway router and the DNS server are correct, what is the configuration problem?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the-IP-addresses-of-the-default-gateway-router-and-the-DNS-server-are-correct-what-is-the-configuration-pr.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The DNS server and the default gateway router should be in the same subnet.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The IP address of the default gateway router is not contained in the excluded address list.</strong></span></li>
<li>The default-router and dns-server commands need to be configured with subnet masks.</li>
<li>The IP address of the DNS server is not contained in the excluded address list.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>In this configuration, the excluded address list should include the address that is assigned to the default gateway router. So the command should be ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.9.</p></div>
<p><strong>100. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator has added a new subnet to the network and needs hosts on that subnet to receive IPv4 addresses from the DHCPv4 server.<br />
What two commands will allow hosts on the new subnet to receive addresses from the DHCP4 server? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-05_183851-1.jpg" /></p>

<li>R2(config)# interface G0/0</li>
<li>R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 10.1.0.254</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>You need the router interface that is connected to the new subnet and the dhcp server address.<br />
The ip helper-address command is used to configure a router to be a DHCPv4 relay. The command should be placed on the interface facing the DHCPv4 clients. When the command is applied on the router interface, the interface will receive DHCPv4 broadcast messages and forward them as unicast to the IP address of the DHCPv4 server.</p></div>
<p><strong>101. What protocol or technology uses source IP to destination IP as a load-balancing mechanism?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VTP</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">EtherChannel</span></strong></li>
<li>DTP</li>
<li>STP</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>102. What protocol should be disabled to help mitigate VLAN attacks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CDP</li>
<li>ARP</li>
<li>STP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DTP</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>103. What protocol or technology requires switches to be in server mode or client mode?</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>DTP</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>104. What are two reasons a network administrator would segment a network with a Layer 2 switch? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to create fewer collision domains</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>to enhance user bandwidth</strong></span></li>
<li>to create more broadcast domains</li>
<li>to eliminate virtual circuits</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>to isolate traffic between segments</strong></span></li>
<li>to isolate ARP request messages from the rest of the network</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A switch has the ability of creating temporary point-to-point connections between the directly-attached transmitting and receiving network devices. The two devices have full-bandwidth full-duplex connectivity during the transmission.</p></div>
<p><strong>105. What command will enable a router to begin sending messages that allow it to configure a link-local address without using an IPv6 DHCP server?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a static route</li>
<li>the ipv6 route ::/0 command</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>the ipv6 unicast-routing command</strong></span></li>
<li>the ip routing command</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To enable IPv6 on a router you must use the ipv6 unicast-routing global configuration command or use the ipv6 enable interface configuration command. This is equivalent to entering ip routing to enable IPv4 routing on a router when it has been turned off. Keep in mind that IPv4 is enabled on a router by default. IPv6 is not enabled by default.<br />
</p></div>
<p><strong>106. A network administrator is using the router-on-a-stick model to configure a switch and a router for inter-VLAN routing. What configuration should be made on the switch port that connects to the router?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Configure it as a trunk port and allow only untagged traffic.</li>
<li>Configure the port as an access port and a member of VLAN1.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Configure the port as an 802.1q trunk port.</strong></span></li>
<li>Configure the port as a trunk port and assign it to VLAN1.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The port on the switch that connects to the router interface should be configured as a trunk port. Once it becomes a trunk port, it does not belong to any particular VLAN and will forward traffic from various VLANs.<br />
</p></div>
<p><strong>107. What are three techniques for mitigating VLAN attacks? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use private VLANs.</li>
<li>Enable BPDU guard.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Enable trunking manually</strong></span></li>
<li>Enable Source Guard.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Disable DTP.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Set the native VLAN to an unused VLAN.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Mitigating a VLAN attack can be done by disabling Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), manually setting ports to trunking mode, and by setting the native VLAN of trunk links to VLANs not in use.</p></div>
<p><strong>108. Match the DHCP message types to the order of the DHCPv4 process. (Not all options are used.)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71595" src="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2021-11-16_223240.png" alt="" width="906" height="927" srcset="https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2021-11-16_223240.png 906w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2021-11-16_223240-293x300.png 293w, https://a5m9a8c3.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2021-11-16_223240-768x786.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px" /><br />
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The broadcast DHCPDISCOVER message finds DHCPv4 servers on the network. When the DHCPv4 server receives a DHCPDISCOVER message, it reserves an available IPv4 address to lease to the client and sends the unicast DHCPOFFER message to the requesting client. When the client receives the DHCPOFFER from the server, it sends back a DHCPREQUEST. On receiving the DHCPREQUEST message the server replies with a unicast DHCPACK message. DHCPREPLY and DHCPINFORMATION-REQUEST are DHCPv6 messages.</p></div></p>
<p><strong>109. In which situation would a technician use the show interfaces switch command?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to determine if remote access is enabled</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>when packets are being dropped from a particular directly attached host</strong></span></li>
<li>when an end device can reach local devices, but not remote devices</li>
<li>to determine the MAC address of a directly attached network device on a particular interface</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The show interfaces command is useful to detect media errors, to see if packets are being sent and received, and to determine if any runts, giants, CRCs, interface resets, or other errors have occurred. Problems with reachability to a remote network would likely be caused by a misconfigured default gateway or other routing issue, not a switch issue. The show mac address-table command shows the MAC address of a directly attached device.<br />
</p></div>
<p><strong>110. What is a drawback of the local database method of securing device access that can be solved by using AAA with centralized servers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no ability to provide accountability.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>User accounts must be configured locally on each device, which is an unscalable authentication solution.</strong></span></li>
<li>It is very susceptible to brute-force attacks because there is no username.</li>
<li>The passwords can only be stored in plain text in the running configuration.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The local database method of securing device access utilizes usernames and passwords that are configured locally on the router. This allows administrators to keep track of who logged in to the device and when. The passwords can also be encrypted in the configuration. However, the account information must be configured on each device where that account should have access, making this solution very difficult to scale.</p></div>
<p><strong>111. What action does a DHCPv4 client take if it receives more than one DHCPOFFER from multiple DHCP servers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It sends a DHCPREQUEST that identifies which lease offer the client is accepting.</strong></span></li>
<li>It sends a DHCPNAK and begins the DHCP process over again.</li>
<li>It discards both offers and sends a new DHCPDISCOVER.</li>
<li>It accepts both DHCPOFFER messages and sends a DHCPACK.</li>
</ul>

The system shows that 3 MAC addresses are allowed on port fa0/2, but only one has been configured and no sticky MAC addresses have been learned. The port is up because of the port status of secure-up. The violation mode is what happens when an unauthorized device is attached to the port. A port must be in access mode in order to activate and use port security.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>DTLS only provides data security through authentication and does not provide encryption for data moving between a wireless LAN controller (WLC) and an access point (AP).</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Although DTLS is enabled by default to secure the CAPWAP control channel, it is disabled by default for the data channel.</strong></span></li>
<li>DTLS is a protocol that only provides security between the access point (AP) and the wireless client.</li>
<li>Data encryption requires a DTLS license to be installed on each access point (AP) prior to being enabled on the wireless LAN controller (WLC).</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> DTLS is a protocol which provides security between the AP and the WLC. It allows them to communicate using encryption and prevents eavesdropping or tampering.<br />
DTLS is enabled by default to secure the CAPWAP control channel but is disabled by default for the data channel.

<li>PVST+ reduces bandwidth consumption compared to traditional implementations of STP that use CST.</li>
<li>PVST+ requires fewer CPU cycles for all the switches in the network.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>PVST+ optimizes performance on the network through load sharing.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p>PVST+ results in optimum load balancing. However, this is accomplished by manually configuring switches to be elected as root bridges for different VLANs on the network. The root bridges are not automatically selected. Furthermore, having spanning-tree instances for each VLAN actually consumes more bandwidth and it increases the CPU cycles for all the switches in the network.<br />

<p><strong>166. A small publishing company has a network design such that when a broadcast is sent on the LAN, 200 devices receive the transmitted broadcast. How can the network administrator reduce the number of devices that receive broadcast traffic?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add more switches so that fewer devices are on a particular switch.</li>
<li>Replace the switches with switches that have more ports per switch. This will allow more devices on a particular switch.</li>
<li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Segment the LAN into smaller LANs and route between them.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Replace at least half of the switches with hubs to reduce the size of the broadcast domain.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong> By dividing the one big network into two smaller network, the network administrator has created two smaller broadcast domains.

<p><strong>172. While attending a conference, participants are using laptops for network connectivity. When a guest speaker attempts to connect to the network, the laptop fails to display any available wireless networks. The access point must be operating in which mode?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mixed</li>
<li>passive</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">active</span></strong></li>
<li>open</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Active is a mode used to configure an access point so that clients must know the SSID to connect to the access point. APs and wireless routers can operate in a mixed mode meaning that that multiple wireless standards are supported. Open is an authentication mode for an access point that has no impact on the listing of available wireless networks for a client. When an access point is configured in passive mode, the SSID is broadcast so that the name of wireless network will appear in the listing of available networks for clients.</p></div>
